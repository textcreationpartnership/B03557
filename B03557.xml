            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And theſe Phraſes are frequently cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, <hi>To fear the Lord, and walk in his Ways,</hi> Deut. 8.6. and Chap. 10.12. This holy Fear of God will make Men meek and humble, and careful in all things to walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing: It will command our Thoughts, bridle and govern our Tongues, and regulate all our Actions. This will quicken us to holy Devotion, and reduce all our devotion to Practice.</p>
            <p>In all Actions, St. <hi>Bernard</hi> would have us put theſe three Queries,

               <hi>An liceat, an deceat, an expediat;</hi> Whether it be lawful, whether it be that which becometh us to do, whether it be expedient to be done.

We ſhould ſay with <hi>Xeuxes,</hi> that famous Painter, <hi>Aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitati Pingo,</hi> I Paint for Eternity.</p>
            <p>It is very neceſſary for us to follow the Counſel of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>and work whilſt it is Day.</hi> A long Night will ſhortly cover us with its ſhadow, in which we ſhall neither have ability nor opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Work.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe Scripture calleth upon us to redeem Time: Now to redeem Time, is, <hi>1.</hi> To ſee that we caſt none of it away in vain, but uſe every minute of it as a moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing, and ſpend it wholly in the way of Duty. <hi>2.</hi> That we be not only doing good, but doing the beſt good we are able, <hi>&amp;c. 3.</hi> That we do the beſt things in the beſt manner, and in the greateſt meaſure, and do as much good as poſſibly we can. <hi>4.</hi> That we watch for ſpecial Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>5.</hi> That we preſently take them when they fall, and improve them when we take them. <hi>6.</hi> That we part with all that is to be parted with to ſave our Time. <hi>7.</hi> That we forecaſt the preventing of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, and the removal of our Clogs, and the obtaining of all helps to expedition
<pb facs="tcp:174423:6"/>in Duty. This is the true redemption of Time, according to the judgment of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divine.</p>
            <p>And indeed the conſideration of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our time in this World, ſhould ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten us in the Work and Service of God. <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>whilſt it is Day; the Night cometh when no Man can work,</hi> John <hi>9.4.</hi> I have but a ſhort Day, the time of this Life, to do the Work which my Father hath ſent me to finiſh here upon the Earth; and now I muſt haſten it, for the time is at hand, I ſhall ſhortly be delivered into the hands of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be Crucified. When the Maſter of the Vineyard ſaw ſome ſtanding idle at the eleventh hour, he checketh them for it: Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? Do ye not know, that it is but one hour to Night, eleven parts of your Life are already gone, there is but one of twelve remaining. Is it not a ſhame for you yet to be idle? How ought ye now to haſten, when but the twelfth part of your ſhort Life yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth?</p>
            <p>A great part of this ſhort Life is taken up in that manner, that little of it is well ſpent. All the time of our Life, till the
<pb facs="tcp:174423:6"/>time of our Converſion, may be laid by, as no Time, or Life to us: And after our effectual calling, ſleeping takes a large part of our time; eating and drinking another part, and far more of it is ſpent in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or in doing that which is evil. Let a Man be as frugal, and as thrifty of his Time as he can, yet much of his Life will go this way. In our old Age many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes draw on, and when we would do good, we are diſabled by Age and Sickneſs. We are long ere we begin to do the Work of God, and are ſoon weary of well-doing. Our Glaſs is almoſt run, before we begin to live indeed; and at the entry of our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, we begin to die by Infirmity: So that by a juſt ſurvey of our time, we ſhall eaſily find, that God who craveth the Tithe of our Subſtance, ſcarcely getteth the hundredth part of our Time, and that of thoſe who beſt ſpend their time.</p>
            <p>Conſider we the greatneſs of the Work that every Chriſtian hath to do in this ſhort time. How great a work is it to get a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Heart, our Hearts being naturally hearts of Stone? How great a task to get an eſtabliſhed aſſurance of the Love of God, we having ſuch evil Hearts of unbelief? How great a work to get forward and
<pb facs="tcp:174423:7"/>grow in Grace, our Hearts being ſo full of corruption, eating out and waſting the ſtrength of Grace, ſo inclined to Back-ſliding and Declining; having ſo many things to preſs down, ſo many weights hanging on? How great a task to eſcape the Corruption that is in the World, and to eſcape ſo many Snares as are ſet in all places? How great a work to get a free and enlarged Heart? How hard to walk conſtantly in the Spirit? How hard to do the Work, and perform the Service of God, in the Power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? How difficult to walk in a conſtant communion with the Lord? What diligence then ought we to uſe in the Service of God, being ſo much ſtraightned with time, and having ſo much to do, and ſo great a task laid upon us?</p>
            <p>Moreover, the ſhortneſs of Life, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the greatneſs of the Account that is to be given up at the end of this Life, ſhould move us with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to haſten in the Work and Service of God. A great account is to be given up to God after a ſhort Life, and therefore great diligence muſt be uſed, that it may be an happy and joyful Account, and that we may be ſure to have all our Sins croſſed out of the Account, and to have many works
<pb facs="tcp:174423:7"/>of Obedience, many pleaſing Services ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt, put upon the Reckoning. Every Maſter calls his Servants to account for what they put into their hands, as to the improvement thereof. And God will call every Man to a reckoning for every Talent they have in their hands, how they have improved them; what they have done for the Glory of God, for the Intereſt of Chriſt, and for the good of their own and others Souls. All our Talents are written down; our uſing, our abuſing them; our ſpending, our miſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: All the times of God's Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Forbearance, and Long-ſufferance, are regiſtred in God's Account-Book: All the Mercies and Bleſſings we have received; all the Ordinances of God, and means of Grace we have enjoyed; all the powerful Sermons we have heard, all theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down in the Book of God's Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and in the Book of our Conſciences. We ſhall all be called to give an account, <hi>Mat. 25.15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</hi> Let us all mind the day of Account, and not put it far from us, in hope that our Maſter will defer his Coming: But let every one labour ſo to do, as he deſireth to be found at his Coming.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Conſider that everlaſting
<pb facs="tcp:174423:8"/>Eſtate which followeth upon ſo ſhort a Life, and which ſhall be according to this ſhort Life, and ſuitable unto it. Now when everlaſting Life followeth upon a ſhort Life, well ſpent to the Glory of God; and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Woe and Miſery upon a Life, ſpent according to the courſe of this World, by thoſe that live in the Fleſh, Oh what Speed, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and Diligence ſhould Men uſe in improving their ſhort lives in the Service of God, that they may inherit everlaſting Life, and eſcape everlaſting Torment!</p>
            <p>Finally, After this ſhort Life, we ſhall have no more ſuch opportunities (as now) to glorifie God here on Earth; we ſhall hear no more Sermons, enjoy no more Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, his Spirit ſhall ſtrive with us no longer. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, nor Wiſdom in the Grave where thou goeſt,</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>9.10.</hi> Death will take away thoſe opportunities which the life of Man affordeth; therefore every Man ought to put forth his might and beſt ſtrength in improving his ſhort life to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>How may this reprove our prodigal and laviſh miſpending of our ſhort Lives. Men
<pb facs="tcp:174423:8"/>that have but a little ſtore of ſuch and ſuch things, are ſparing and thrifty in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and diſpoſing them: Scarcity of any ſort of Proviſion, moveth Men to make ſpare of it. What is more ſcanty than time? What hath a Man leſs ſtore of than of Life? No Man knoweth how little he hath, and he that hath moſt, hath but little. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reckon upon many Years of Life to come, who perhaps have not ſo may Days, it may be not ſo many Hours as they reckon Years. The truth is, no Man is ſure of any more than the preſent time of his Life. All the time paſt which was ill-ſpent, is loſt; and whether any be yet remaining to thee, thou art uncertain: And if any be, it is as like to ſlide away from thee without profit, as that which is paſt, if now thou be laviſh and careleſs in loſing and caſting away the preſent time. How eaſily may Satan lead thee on ſtep by ſtep to Hell, whilſt thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thy ſelf with thoughts afar off for Heaven, with remote purpoſes for Heaven and newneſs of Life? Haſt thou not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over many Weeks and Days already, when thou hadſt a purpoſe to have turn'd unto the Lord, and to have broken off thy Sins by Repentance? Thou haſt the ſame deceitful Heart ſtill, to flatter thee with
<pb facs="tcp:174423:9"/>hopes and purpoſes of Repentance for time to come. The ſame Devil there is ſtill to draw thee on from Day to Day, from Week to Week, to perſwade thee from time to time to take longer Day, until the days of thy ſhort Life waſte away, and thou periſh in thy Sin, and find no place for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Oh how ſhould this make Men tremble! Thy whole Life is but as an Hand-breadth,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.</note> a ſhort ſpace of time. Oh then think how wretchedly laviſh thou haſt been already of this ſhort precious time! It may be thou haſt not ſo many Weeks behind, as thou haſt loſt Years already; and all the Daies of thy Life which thou haſt ſpent in a ſtate of Impenitency and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregeneration, are loſt; and thou haſt no fruit of them in reſpect of Salvation. The longer thou haſt lived in the Fleſh, and haſt not been led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou art the nearer Hell and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and all this while thou haſt been heaping up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. And is not this time wofully caſt away? Howſoever thou haſt thrived in the World, encreaſed thine outward Eſtate, gotten Things about thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all thy time is loſt; and it were better for thee
<pb facs="tcp:174423:9"/>never to have ſeen thoſe Days, if thou haſt lived an Impenitent and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Life. Oh then waſte no more of this precious time, of this ſhort Life! There is ſo much of this precious Oyl ſpilt on the Ground; there are but a few drops left to nouriſh the flame, and to keep light in the Lamp: Take heed leſt that alſo be ſpent and conſumed, and thy life go out like a Candle with a ſtinking Snuff, and end in perpetual Shame and Miſery. If yet thou art not turned unto the Lord by ſound Repentance, and haſt not yet begun to do the Work of God, then now whilſt it is called to Day, hearken to the Voice of God, and ſpeedily turn unto him; defer not thy ſetting about this Work till to morrow: Loſe not ſo many precious hours about the World, ſpend not ſo many in carnal Delights and vain Pleaſures, in idle Talk, or in doing nothing; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping more than thy weakneſs requireth: redeem time from all theſe; and the rather, becauſe ye know ye have but a few ſteps to your Grave. Whoſoever of us is appointed in the ſeeret Counſel of God to live longeſt here, yet the Day is not long, the night of Death is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening upon us. The longeſt Summer's Day is ſoon at an end, and the longeſt Life
<pb facs="tcp:174423:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon Earth paſſeth away, as a Tale that is told. Let us then endeavour this ſhort Life ſo, that it may be lengthened out with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life and Bleſſedneſs. God hath given us time to make our Peace with him; and if that be neglected, all is loſt, and we are undone for ever. It is reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> that when he marched againſt any City, his manner was to ſet up a Lamp burning, and made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, That whoſoever oame in, and ſubmitted whilſt this Lamp was burning, ſhould find Favour, and have his Life: But whoſoever ſtaid till this Lamp was out, he was but a dead Man, and muſt expect no Mercy. — Know ye, O Chriſtians, that God hath ſet up a Lamp, and our life is this Lamp, and God proclaims, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes in, whilſt this Lamp is burning, ſhall find Mercy; but if you ſtay till the Lamp is out, till your life be conſumed, there is nothing but eternal Woe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Now this Lamp of your lives, may not only go out on the conſumption of the Oyl, but it may be put out by accidental means; and if this Lamp be once out, and your Work not done, ye are loſt and undone for ever. Eccleſ. <hi>11.3. In the place where the Tree falleth, there it lieth.</hi> Which
<pb facs="tcp:174423:10"/>way thou falleſt when thou dieſt, that way thou ſhalt lie to Eternity; if towards God, then God is thine for ever; if toward Sin, the Miſery and Deſtruction is thine for ever. There can be no repenting nor believing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death; the Soul and Body being parted, the whole Man is not capable of a Work of God upon it.</p>

               <p>IT is good for Man to <hi>draw near to God,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>ult.</hi> This Gloſs put upon any thing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it unto Man; for naturally ſince the Fall there is ſo much left in Man, that he hath an inclination to that which is good; but when he cometh to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, here is the Miſtake, he ſeeks Light in the way of Darkneſs, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the way of Miſery, and Life in the way of Death, being hurried the contrary way by the violence of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Luſts. But yet there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174423:14"/>tendency in all Men to that which is good, (as ſome of the Heathen have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) from the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there remaining this general Foundation of Religion in all Men. Good hath a magnetick Force, and is of a drawing Nature, and anſwerable to the Diſcovery of Good or Evil in the Underſtanding, there is an Embracing or Averſation in the Will of Man, which is that part in the Soul of the Man that cleaveth unto Good diſcovered. It is good to draw near to God, who is <hi>ſummum Bonum,</hi> the chiefeſt Good. The Goodneſs of a thing is the Reaſon why we deſire it. It is the Philoſophers Definition of Good, <hi>That is Good which all things do deſire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bonum eſt quod omnia appetunt.</note> Now then, what is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ble is more excelling in Goodneſs, and what is chiefly deſirable is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good. All Creatures do naturally deſire their chief Good, their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their Perfection. And it is the Happineſs of Man to draw near to God, his Creator.</p>
               <p>The Mind of a Chriſtian may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſlip from God, and for a time be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174423:14"/>taken up with other things, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long be kept from him, becauſe God is its Center; and it is as natural for a Spiritual Mind to move towards God, as for a Needle touched with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to point towards the North Pole. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. Where God hath no place in our Minds, we have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him. A pious and devout Man muſt be continually with God. If the hungry Man cannot forget to eat, nor the thirſty Man to drink, then cannot a Man forget God. Who lives under a continual ſence of the want of God, his Soul is ſtill breathing and panting after God. Love cauſeth an emiſſion of the Thoughts, it will not ſuffer him to dwell at home, but to be where it is beſt of all to be. There's a Neceſſity a Man ſhould mind what he moſt affecteth, and a Man that loveth God cannot live in a Courſe of Forgetfulneſs of God; either (as an holy Man noteth) Want brings him, or Love conſtrains him, or Chriſt draws him; and Chriſt will not be long from his; if their Hearts come not up to him, he will come into them; and if he be there, all is taken up with attending upon him.</p>

The Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as a Torch-light in a dark Room; the New Teſtament revealed by the Spirit is as the Dawning of the Day, or Riſing of the Day-Star, in compariſon of that Light which ſhall appear at Chriſt's ſecond Coming, which ſhall be as the bright Riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Conſider, that as the Dawning of the Day is in reſpect of the Night, ſo is a Soul enlightned with the ſaving Knowledg of the Goſpel to one in his natural Blindneſs. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If we compare ſuch a Soul to thoſe poor Creatures that want the outward Means of Knowledg, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; for theſe have no Light offered them, whereby to come to know God in a ſaving way; therefore in reſpect of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:174423:18"/>this Knowledg there is a meer Night of Ignorance among them. The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that want the Means of Knowledge is plainly expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17, 18. where he ſheweth, that the <hi>Gentiles walk in the Vanity of their minds, having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their Heart.</hi> Where you may conſider, that they are ſo far from having ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as doth guide them unto Life and Salvation, that they are alienated from the Life of God through the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. It is ſaid, that the <hi>World by wiſdom knew not God.</hi> They had a kind of Wiſdom wherein many of them excelled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they knew many Secrets of Nature, many Affairs of State and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all their Wiſdom for want of the Word did not teach them the right Knowledg of God in a ſaving way.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo, that as the Heathens that wanted the Word, ſo the Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, that live under the Miniſtery of the Word, do remain in darkneſs, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174423:18"/>Day doth not dawn unto them, nor doth the Day-Star ariſe in their Hearts, or elſs, if the Day do dawn in their Brains, it is dark Night in their Hearts; if they do get ſome knowledg of the Goſpel, and Myſteries of Salvation, yet this Light doth not pierce ſo as to win them to the Love of that Truth and Light which appeareth unto them, and to ſubject their Hearts unto the Power of it.</p>
               <p>Now in the Regenerate, the Goſpel being revealed to them by the Spirit, is as the dawning of the Day, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Day-Star in their Hearts, in compariſon of that Night of Blindneſs, which was in themſelves before Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and is yet in others that are unregenerate; for firſt, the Day dawns in their Underſtandings, and then the Day-Star ariſeth in their Hearts; then the Night begins to wear away, and the Day breaks and dawns upon them, then they begin to ſee what they could not ſee before, and to ſee that far more clearly and effectually, which they ſaw in ſome imperfect meaſure before. Now the Spirit having cauſed the Day to <hi>dawn</hi> in their Underſtandings, he proceedeth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:174423:19"/>alſo to enlighten the lower Region, and to cauſe the Day-Star to ariſe in their Hearts; as in the Night time, when the Sun is on the other ſide of the Earth, it ſhineth brightly, and enlightneth the Stars, as we ſee, yet the Body of the Earth being between the Sun and us, maketh it dark here below; ſo when the Spirit enlightens the Underſtanding of an unregenerate Man with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel, even at the ſame time there is a Body of Death in his heart, and a Maſs of ſinful Corruptions, which caſts a Shadow, and keeps the Heart and Affections in miſerable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now as every Coruption is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Darkneſs, ſo every Grace is a Beam of heavenly Light; for God is Light, and every Grace is a Part of the Image and Likeneſs of God, and ſo is <hi>Lumen de Lumine,</hi> Light iſſuing from the Fountain of Light.

<note place="margin">

                  <p n="5">5. Light doth <hi>viſum delectare,</hi> it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Eye-ſight. <hi>Light is ſweet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. ſo Grace is pleaſant to an Eye that is ſpiritually enlightned.

                  <p n="6">6. Light doth <hi>Occulta manifeſtare,</hi> manifeſt things that are hid. In the Dark there is no judging of Colours, but the Light makes all things manifeſt. So doth the light of Grace, it doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt thoſe things unto us, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were hidden from us; eſpecially
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:174423:22"/>two ſorts of things, <hi>Dei miſericordiam, &amp; noſtram indigentiam:</hi> God's Mercies, and our own Wants. As for God's Mercies, without the light of Grace, we cannot judg of them as we ſhould do: Either we take no notice of them at all; or we aſcribe not the having them, to him from whom indeed we receive them. And as for our Wants, the more our Eyes are opened to ſee them, the more hath the light of Grace ſhined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Hearts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p>The conſideration hereof, ſhould teach us to love Grace, and to hate Sin: We naturally hate Darkneſs, and love Light.

               </head>
               <p>HEre conſider, that Chriſt in his coming into the World, was as the Day-ſpring from on high, or the ſpringing or riſing of the Sun from on high, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78. Conſider how his coming is moſt fitly compared to a Day-ſpring, or to the riſing of the Sun, in divers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sun doth (as it were) iſſue out of the Night, as appeareth to our Eyes: He ſeemeth to ſpring out of the womb of Darkneſs: The riſing of the Sun followeth the darkneſs of the Night. So our bleſſed Saviour at his coming, did ſeem (as it were) to ſpring out of Darkneſs; he lay hid before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Veil; he was covered with Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Types, Ceremonies, Myſtical
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:174423:23"/>Repreſentations, Dark Figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, the Prophecies which did bear witneſs of him had much darkneſs in them, though they were ſo clear, that they ſhewed the way to Chriſt unto all the Faithful: Yet the Light was but dim, in compariſon of that which followed. And at that time eſpecially there was much darkneſs overſpreading the Face of the Church, even about the time of our Saviours coming. Then was that true which is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.9. <hi>We ſee not our Signs, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there among us, any that knoweth how long.</hi> And beſides the want of this Light, there were ſpecial cauſes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>viz.</hi> blind Guides: For ſuch our Saviour himſelf charged the Phariſees to be, who ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Chair;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind and ignorant themſelves, took upon them to lead the blind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Ignorant, and ſo no marvel, though both ſtumbled in the dark, and fell into the Ditch; and ignorance in theſe bred Errours in the People, and cauſed an increaſe of Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>But now conſider, That Chriſt was not ſent for the ſalvation of the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but of other Nations alſo; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174423:23"/>ſo conſider what darkneſs was on the World in general. The Nations of the World were all Regions of darkneſs, and of the Shadow of Death; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls thoſe Ages <hi>Saecula tenebrarum,</hi> Ages of Darkneſs. Even the learned <hi>Athenians</hi> worſhipped God as a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and their Altar had this Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>To the unknown God.</hi> Now out of this Darkneſs (as it were) the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring iſſued, Chriſt came and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Day-ſpring, or Riſing of the Sun, removeth the Darkneſs, ſo Chriſt manifeſted in the Fleſh did chaſe away that Darkneſs, which was upon the face of the World, and ſoon after Chriſt's coming there was ſuch an Alteration, as if there had been a new World created, as it is expreſſed of the Land of <hi>Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali</hi> and <hi>Zabulon,</hi> ſo the like Change was alſo in many parts of the World, <hi>The Land of</hi> Zabulon, <hi>and the Land of</hi> Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali, <hi>by the way of the Sea beyond</hi> Jordan, Galilee <hi>of the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>The People which ſate in darkneſs, ſaw great light; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them which ſate in the Region and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, is Light ſprung up.,</hi> Mat.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174423:24"/>4.15, 16. Thus it might be ſaid of the World in general.</p>
               <p>The Day-ſpring or Sun-riſing is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and glorious. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5. <hi>David</hi> compares the Sun at his riſing to a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom coming forth of his Chamber with all his Ornaments. Chriſt's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation to the World was glorious, and full of heavenly Beauty and Majeſty. Many glorious things appeared in him at his Birth, and in his Life many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Signs and Wonders; and among other things, the Beauty of his perfect Holineſs and Righteouſneſs was ſuch, that even the malicious Eye of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries could ſee no ſpot or blemiſh in it: but eſpecially in that more glorious manifeſtation at his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and ſending down the Holy Ghoſt, by whom his Apoſtles were led abroad to carry the Light up and down in the World, his Beauty, Excellency, and Glory did appear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Day-ſpring, or Sun riſing yeildeth ſpecial Refreſhment to the Creatures, Men, Beaſts, Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Coming of Chriſt yeilded ſpecial Comfort and Refreſhment to the People of God, yea, and to thoſe who formerly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:174423:24"/>were not the People of God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10. Many poor Gentiles after a tedious Night of many hundred years of woful Darkneſs and Blindneſs, were now moſt ſweetly refreſhed by the manifeſtation of Chriſt, as a glorious Day-ſpring, and a moſt bleſſed Sun of Righteouſneſs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with healing in his Wings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſaw the way of Peace, and the means of Reconciliation with God, and everlaſting Salvation by the Remiſſion of their Sins in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, that the Day-ſpring or Sun riſing is a Cauſe of Health. The Night is cold and moiſt, and for want of heat to purge the Air, is the Cauſe of many thick Fogs and Vapours; but the Sun ariſing cleanſeth the Air, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh thoſe foggy Vapours. So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is ſaid of Chriſt, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sun of Righteouſneſs, ſhould ariſe with healing in his Wings, diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe unwholſom Vapours, which the Devil, the Prince of Darkneſs, had raiſed to poiſon the Souls of Men and Women. This Sun of Righteouſneſs did by the Sovereign Balm of his moſt precious Blood cure the Wounds of Guiltineſs which were upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:174423:25"/>and by the precious Sun-beams of his Spirit did heal them of thoſe Corruptions, and Soul-ſickneſſes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them Spiritual Health, even the Spirit of Love and Power, and of a ſound Mind.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Day-ſpring, or Sun-riſing, calleth Men out of their Beds, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth them from their Sleep: ſo Chriſt by his manifeſtation unto the World doth call Men from ſleeping in Sin, to awake unto Repentance unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth plainly, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, &amp;c. <hi>The times of this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance God winked at; but now command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Men every where to repent.</hi> That Night-time, which was before the Day-ſpring, and coming of Chriſt, <hi>God wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but now commandeth all Men every where to repent.</hi> It was the time of Sleep, and God ſuffered the World to lie ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſnorting in Sin and Wickedneſs, he winked at them, and awaked them not; but now he calleth upon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, that is, to repent, now it is Day, the Night is paſt; yea, ſaith he, <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all men every where.</hi> The Lord ſent his Meſſengers from Nation to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from City to City, to awake the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:174423:25"/>World at the Day-ſpring, and at the riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Day-ſpring, or Sun-riſing, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Men light, and ſheweth them both how to walk and work: <hi>He is that Light which enlightneth every one that cometh into the World,</hi> John 12.35, 36. Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, <hi>Yet a little while is the Light with you, walk while ye have the Light, leſt darkneſs come upon you; for he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth. While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that you may be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light.</hi> Chriſt's coming ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way wherein we muſt go, if we will be ſaved. The World for want of this Light, groped, and loſt the way to true Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Day-ſpring, and Sun-riſing, doth cauſe thoſe things that are harmful to hide themſelves. The wild raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beaſts that prey upon others, uſe to get to their Caves and Coverts, at the Sun-riſing, ſhunning the light. Thieves and Murtherers, which in the Night, uſe to break through and ſteal, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire themſelves, and refrain at the riſing of the Sun. So at the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Herod</hi> and his company were troubled,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:174423:26"/>and all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with him. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were troubled, and the Devil himſelf eſpecially, that Prince of Darkneſs, and that great Worker of the works of darkneſs was troubled, and cried out, <hi>Art thou come to Torment us before the time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Day-ſpring, or Sun-riſing is welcome to thoſe who are well buſied, and diligently walk in an honeſt Courſe of Life. So the coming of Chriſt as a Day-ſpring, and Sun of Righteouſneſs, was very welcome to thoſe that walked uprightly before the Lord; it was the time which they had long looked for, more than they that watch for the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Therefore their Eyes were upon this Day-ſpring. So <hi>Zechary, Elizabeth, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Simeon, Anna,</hi> the Godly Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and the reſt, flocked about our Saviour, like a company in the dark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Torch, or Candle: Yea, the Wiſe Men of the Eaſt, by a leſſer light, were brought to this great Light, by the light of a little Star were conducted to Chriſt, the great Light of the World, <hi>John</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Light of the World; he that followeth me ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of Life.</hi>

How many reaſons of things that fall out in the World, are now hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from Men? How many ſecrets are there in the ways of God's Providence, and his dealings with the World, and with his Church, which in this Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of blindneſs and darkneſs we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee? Yea, how little do we ſee of the Excellency of Chriſt, of the beauty of Heavenly Things, and of the Glory of his Kingdom? Theſe are dark Times, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:174423:27"/>little of theſe things is diſcovered. Yea, how little do Men ſee into the Vanity, Vileneſs of Earthly things? Who ſeeth the exceeding ſinfulneſs of Sin, and odiouſneſs of it? How many ſecret ſins are now committed every hour, which are hid in darkneſs? Theſe are Times of darkneſs which now we live in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt coming of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, That Chriſt's laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Day-ſpring, ſhall remove this darkneſs of the World, and lay open things that were hidden, and diſpel all the dark Clouds that now hide the Light from us: It ſhall remove the Ignorance of heavenly things from the minds of Men; Chriſt himſelf ſhall be the Light of that Day. Then the things which are now imperfectly, ſhall then be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known; then ſhall the Saints put away childiſh things, imperfect begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Heavenly Knowledg, and ſhall have the underſtandings of Men in them; a perfection of Light, not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a Glaſs darkly, but Face to Face. How clearly ſhall the light of that Day ſhew unto the Saints, the Beauty and Glory of Chriſt, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him to his Church as a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174423:27"/>Bridegroom? Conſider how that Day ſhall declare the equity of all the Lord's proceedings in dealing with his Creatures? How ſhall it cauſe all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and objections againſt it to vaniſh as a Miſt? How ſhall it lay open the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vanity of Men, in cleaving to the things of this World, and in following their Luſts? How evidently ſhall it make it appear, that the Godly have choſen the better part; that they were truly wiſe that preferred the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Glory of Chriſt, yea, the Reproach of Chriſt, above the pleaſures of Sin, or the greateſt things in the World? How ſhall this Day ſet forth all ſecrets in the clear Light? How ſhall all Sins not waſht away by true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, be ſet before the eye of the World? How then ſhall the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Upright be brought forth, after it hath been many years hidden by Slanders and falſe Accuſations? How ſhall all their works of Faith, all their labours of Love, and all the fruits of the Spirit be laid open and manifeſted? There are no falſe lights that can have any place at that Day, to make bad Wares ſeem better, every thing ſhall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:174423:28"/>then appear as it is. O my Soul! how ſhouldſt thou labour in thy moſt ſecret places, and in thy moſt ſecret thoughts, to bear in mind the light of that great Day, when Chriſt ſhall appear as a Day-ſpring unto the World! Will theſe thoughts which I cheriſh in my Heart, theſe Affections, theſe Words, theſe Deeds, be able to abide the great light of that Day, when Chriſt ſhall come? Are they ſuch as may be preſented with boldneſs before the Face of Chriſt, and offered to the view of the holieſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in Heaven, and be brought to the open Light, when the Son of Righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine in his Strength?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, That Chriſt's ſecond coming ſhall be in Power and great Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

O my Soul! labour now to behold his Beauty, and Glory in the Spirit by Faith, and by that glimpſe raiſe thy thoughts to conſider of that height and brightneſs of Glory, wherein Chriſt ſhall ſhew himſelf at that Day; and how thine Eye, and thy Soul ſhall be filled with a moſt ſweet delight in his perfect Beauty and Glory. Could our Hearts be throughly taken up with Chriſt's Glory at that great Day, it would be a means to mortifie our fond deſires towards theſe things, wherewith our fleſhly Eyes or Hearts, are apt to be enſnared. It would greatly ſupport us under Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What, ſhould not I ſuffer with patience, who look to ſee the Beauty and Glory of Chriſt at the laſt Day? Yea, to ſee the glorious Face of Chriſt turned to me in love, might I not paſs through Troubles, Priſons, Famine, Nakedneſs, Baniſhment, Fire, Sword, any thing, in hope to behold the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory of Chriſt, and to enjoy the light of his Countenance for ever, when he ſhall come as a Day-ſpring from on High?</p>

But chiefly, Chriſt ſhall be welcome to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelf, for then they ſhall ſee him as he is. Conſider, what a bleſſed ſight will this be, O my Soul, to ſee thy dear Saviour, who hath died for thee, loved thee, and waſhed thee with his own Blood, to ſee him now ſo Glorious: To ſee him on the Throne, who was nailed to the Croſs; to ſee him Reigning and Judging, who was Judged and Condemned; to ſee him moſt Bleſſed, who was made a Curſe; to ſee his Righteouſneſs ſhine forth to all the World, who was numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Tranſgreſſors, to ſee him in ſuch excellent Majeſty, and fulneſs of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this will be moſt welcome.

               <p>Think with thy ſelf, O Chriſtian, when thou art riſing out of thy Bed, what a wonderful ſight that ſhall be, to ſee the Sea and the Earth bring forth in all parts ſuch variety of Bodies, and to behold ſo many huge Armies riſing out of their Beds of death and darkneſs, and ſo many ſorts of diverſities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People gathered and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together: To ſee the moſt mighty Princes, and moſt puiſſant Potentates of the Earth, raiſed out of their Tombs, and appearing with another manner of

<note place="margin">Rom. 13.11.</note> It is high time to awake out of ſleep. Awake unto Righteouſneſs, and ſin not,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.34. It is not enough that ye affect Righteouſneſs, and to

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:174423:38"/>their Sin made them ſenſible of their Nakedneſs, and they made them Aprons of Leaves, ſeeking to hide that from their Eyes, which did diſpleaſe their Souls, and not being able to ſhun them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they endeavoured to cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But God himſelf, who was indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to them, cut out their firſt Sute, and cloathed them with the Skins of Beaſts. This is one uſe of Apparel, namely, to cover our Nakedneſs, and to hide our Body, which began to be ſhameful, when it ceaſed to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe of Apparel is to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from the Injury of the Seaſons, and to free our Bodies from the rigour of the Elements; for Man no ſooner violated God's Commandment, but all the Creatures rebelled againſt him; and thoſe four Bodies, whereof all our Bodies are compoſed, declared War one againſt another to afflict us, and breaking the Bounds which Nature had preſcribed them, intrencht one upon another, to the end their Diviſion might be our Puniſhment. Now Man was bound to make him clothes, he hunted wild Beaſts, and clothed himſelf with their Skins,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:174423:38"/>and robbed his Subjects, that he might defend himſelf againſt his Enemies; and learn'd to his coſt, that no <hi>Apparel</hi> is <hi>proof</hi> for all ſeaſons, but that of Innocency. Here then let every Man ſee his own Fault in his Apparel, which is a ſenſible Token of his Diſobedience; and would he govern himſelf by Reaſon, he would (as it were) chaſtiſe his Body as oft as he puts on his Clothes. And yet many now ſeem to have a deſign to outbrave Divine Juſtice, to glory in its Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make that ſerve for their Glory, which ought to ſerve for their ſhame. <hi>Adam</hi> was never ſo aſhamed as when he was forced to cloath himſelf, the Skins he wore were the Apparel of a Penitent; he never cloathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he bewailed his Innocency; and when cold Weather made him put on more Clothes, he conſidered how the Irregularity of the Seaſons was the Puniſhment of his Sin.

               <p n="2">2. When you are putting on your Clothes upon your Bodies, let this put you in mind of putting on Chriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> Put on Chriſt by Faith in Juſtification for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for he is <hi>made unto us of God, wiſdom and Righteouſneſs.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:174423:39"/>in the Lord, my Soul ſhall be joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me with the Garment of Salvation; he hath covered me with the Robes of Righteouſneſs, as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom decks himſelf with Ornaments, and as a Bride arrayeth her ſelf with her Jewels.</hi> Happy are they who are thus cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, for they ſhall never be found Naked.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When you are putting off your old Clothes, ſee that ye put off the Old Man with all his Works, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That ye put off concerning the former converſation the Old Man,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.22, 24.</note> which is corrupt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceitful luſts.</hi> Look as it is in Apparel, we muſt firſt put off an old Sute, before we can draw on a New; ſo here, we muſt put off the Old Man, that is, the old quality of our whole Nature.</p>
               <p>Here meditate, That you are covered with Sin, as with a Garment: As a Garment covers us, ſo Sin covers us: But it is not this or that Garment; not like an Hat that doth only cover the Head, nor like a Glove that doth cover the Hand only; or like a Boot that doth cover the Leg only; or like a Skirt that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:174423:40"/>doth only cover the Loyns, but it is like a Garment that covereth us allover Head and Hands, Loyns and Legs. As Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſwadled and lapt over in Clouts, ſo are we in Sin, and that from the Crown of the Head to the Soles of the Feet, as the Prophet ſpeaketh. Now ſeeing we are covered with Sin as with a Garment, as we would caſt off a Garment, ſo muſt we caſt off Sin. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes, calleth them <hi>filthy Rags;</hi> how filthy then be our Sins? We muſt ſtrip our ſelves of them, and inſtead of them get to have fair Robes put upon us; as <hi>Joſhua</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igh Prieſt came out firſt in filthy Garments, but thoſe being taken off, fair Robes were put upon him.</p>
               <p>We muſt not lay our Sins aſide, as we uſe to lay our Garments aſide; we lay our Garments off at Night, and put them on uſually in the Morning: We have our Sabbath-Day Garments, and our Working-day Garments; thoſe we wear one day in the Week, theſe all the Week long; we muſt not do thus by our Sins. And yet I would there were not thoſe that did thus, they lay
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:174423:40"/>off their Sins, as they lay off their Garments. Indeed they go off at Night, ſo long as they are aſleep they think not of them, but in the Morning they go on again, and walk familiarly in them; or they ſhall off upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day perhaps. When their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day Clothes are on, then they go as if they were covered with Zeal and Devotion; but with their Week-day Sutes, they put on their Week-day ſins, and then day after day, they as commonly practiſe the one, as they wear the other. As we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put on Chriſt, ſo having put him on, we muſt keep him on, and not when we liſt put him off again; we are not ſo to put off Sin, as when we liſt to put it on again; rather put on Shame, than put on Sin. In a word, Though you are to caſt off Sin like a Garment, yet not like a wearing Garment, for then you will one time or other get it about you again; but like a rotten Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like a menſtruous Garment, like a leprous Garment, like a diſeaſed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like a Priſon-Garment; as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> left his Priſon Garments when he was brought before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:174423:41"/>they were once put off, never put them on again. So ſhould we leave off our Sins, not only <hi>ſeponere,</hi> but <hi>deponere,</hi> not only lay them apart, but quite caſt them away, never to reſume them any more.</p>

And what is Gold, which Men diſguiſe into ſo many Shapes, which is ſought for with ſo much Labour, gotten many times ſo Unjuſtly, and kept with ſo much Care, but the Excrement of the moſt barren Soyl, to which the Fire gives Luſtre, and humane errour Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? And what is the fineſt Linnen wherewith multitudes of People are ſo much covered, and wherein the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their Vanity conſiſts, but a kind of Herb and Graſs, which grows up and flouriſheth in the Fields, wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and dieth in a ſhort time, which paſſeth through Womens hands, which is wetted with their Spittle, turned with the Spindle, ſtretcht upon the Loom, wrought with the Shuttle, whitened in the Dew, and at laſt cut out into ſeveral ſorts of things wherewith the Bodies of Men and Women are adorned? Muſt not that Man or Woman have loſt their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhall be proud of ſuch Trifles?

But their Adorning muſt not be ſo much that outward adorning of plaiting the Hair, and of wearing of Gold, and of putting on of Apparrel, as the hidden Man of the Heart: Yet in times of great Calamity and Afflictions, even great Perſons muſt lay aſide their Ornaments, when the Wrath and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God is broken out againſt a Land, or People.

               <p>GOD commanded the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 23.19. <hi>The firſt of the Firſt-fruits of the Land, thou ſhalt bring into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> God would not only have the Firſt-fruits, but the firſt of the Firſt-fruits; if there were any ripe ſooner than other, God called for them. Which inſtructeth us, that we muſt not only give God the Firſt-fruits of the Day, but the earlieſt time in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the Firſt of the Firſt-fruits of the Day. This was the practice of holy <hi>Job,</hi> in the behalf of his Children; <hi>He ſent and ſanctified them, and roſe up early in the Morning, and offered Burnt-Offerings according to the number of them all,</hi> Job 1.5, 6. As it is God's due, ſo it is our Duty, to dedicate the Morning, the firſt and beſt of every Day to God. Pſal. 5.3. <hi>David</hi> ſaith unto God, <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the Morning, in the Morning will I direct my Prayer to thee,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:174423:47"/>and will look up.</hi> As the Morning is a good friend to the Muſes, ſo it is a great friend to the Graces; as the Morning is the beſt ſtudying time, ſo I judg the Morning to be the beſt Praying time. So <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeaks unto <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 8.5. <hi>[If thou wouldſt ſeek unto God betimes.]</hi> In ſtrictneſs of Tranſlation, it may thus be rendred, <hi>If thou wouldſt ſeek unto God in the Morning;</hi> or, <hi>If thou wouldſt morning God:</hi> be with him early in the Morning; which is the firſt part, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Day, then pour out thy Heart unto God in Prayer. It was an ancient Courſe to ſeek God early in the Morning. And the very Heathens by the light of Nature, took this Courſe in their Profane and Superſtitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

               </head>
               <p>IT is good to retire our ſelves into our Cloſets every Morning betimes, to Pray, and give Thanks unto the Lord. Here you may give thanks unto God for all Benefits received in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and particularly for thoſe you have received the Night paſt, and at that inſtant, which at that time you are to ſet before you, that you may ſeaſon the Action with ſome new reliſh. But more eſpecially, when the Lord hath vouchſafed you any ſpecial, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) unexpected Favour, it doth not beſeem you (as vain Worldlings) to look big, ſcorn every one, to whom the Lord hath not opened the Hand of his Bounty ſo wide as to your ſelves; but rather in an humble ſence
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:174423:48"/>of your unworthineſs, and admiration of God's Goodneſs, to retire your ſelves early, and pour out your Hearts in Prayer and Thankſgiving before the Lord.</p>
               <p>So when the Lord hath given you ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Teſtimonies of his Preſence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and revealed his Love unto you more fully then ordinarily, it is a fit time for you to enter into your Cloſets, there privately, and ſo the more freely, to open your Hearts unto the Lord, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your acquaintance with your Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; to endear your ſelf unto Jeſus Chriſt, and to caſt your ſelves into his embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpeaking to the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I paſſed by thee, and thy time was a time of Love.</hi> So a Chriſtian ſhould be watchful to obſerve the Lord paſſing by, and preſenting himſelf, and take notice of the times of Love, and then it will be his wiſdom to ſpend ſome time in private Prayer, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Thankſgiving, and ſo to take his fill of Love: and to that end I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Morning as the fitteſt time for this purpoſe: If we are frequent in this Courſe, we ſhall grow more inward
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:174423:49"/>and entire with the Lord: Wherea when the Lord daily expreſſeth Love and Kindneſs to us, if we ſhould ſhew our ſelves coy, unkind, and regardleſs of his Love; this were the way to make him more ſtrange unto us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the reaſon why we have no more communion with Chriſt for the moſt part, is becauſe we give him no better entertainment when he cometh. A Man of place and quality, if he ſhall come to viſit a Friend at his Houſe in the Morning, and ſhall hear that he is yet in his Bed, and will not riſe to keep him company, or perceive that every ſmall trifle will keep him out of ſight, he will not be an ordinary Gueſt at that Houſe. Now God is ſaid to viſit us every Morning, that is, as ſoon as the Day breaks, or the Sun is up, God is viſiting. <hi>What is Man, that thou ſhouldſt magnifie him, and ſet thine Heart upon him, and viſit him every Morning,</hi> &amp;c. Job 7.17, 18. Our viſits are uſually in the Afternoon, it is an extraordinary thing to viſit one in the Forenoon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially very early in the Morning. God's viſits are extraordinary, he viſits in a Morning, and viſits every Morning;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174423:49"/>as often as the Morning returneth, ſo often doth he come and viſit us. God viſits us (as one ſaith) in a Morning as a Shepherd viſits his Flock, leſt any ſhould be hurt, or ſtrayed away. As ſure as the Sun riſeth, or the Morning cometh, ſo God viſiteth us with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Therefore <hi>his Mercies are ſaid to be renewed every Morning,</hi> Lamen. 3.23. Or freſh every Morning.</p>

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:174423:50"/>ſaith, Thankfulneſs was fignified; for as the Fire ſtill aſcendeth upwards, ſo Thankfulneſs lifteth up our Hearts, and makes them aſcend unto God: And it is fit that the Divine Benefits ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten, as the Fire of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was never to be extinguiſhed. <hi>It well becometh the Righteous to be thankful,</hi> Pſal. 33.1. That which becometh us well, we are apt to like well: Any Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, any Dreſſing, any Faſhion or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture that makes us graceful and comely in the places where we are. Now <hi>Thank fulneſs,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is a comely thing:</hi> It renders us lovely and amiable, both in the Eyes of God and Man, whereas Unthankfulneſs on the other ſide, like ſome ſordid Diſguiſe, or like ſome ugly Blemiſh upon the Body, makes us Monſtrous and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the eyes of the Beholders.</p>
               <p>The Creatures teach us the retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Thankfulneſs. The Air draws us up vapours out of the Earth: When it hath turned the vapours into Showres, it poureth them into the Earth again, and moiſteneth the dry Womb of it.

You know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the Sea, <hi>All Rivers go into the Sea,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.7. to note the place whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and go. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation upon it, That God is as the Sea, and we ſhould be as the Rivers: All Bleſſings come from God, as Rivers from the Sea; and as Rivers to the Sea, ſo we ſhould return our praiſes to him. Indeed, that is as much as we can do, and ſo much we ſhould do.</p>
               <p>This Act (as one noteth) conſiſteth in three things. 1. In the Memory, which repreſenteth to the underſtanding the benefit received; and this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conſiders the Hand that gives them, and to whom, and how, and by what ways and means, and in what meaſure. Thereupon an affectionate acknowledgment is made in the Will; which not able to continue idle, ſpreads it ſelf into outward Acts, to teſtifie the fervour of its affection. Now to practiſe this well, it is requiſite that we ſhould make and keep a Catalogue of all the Benefits of God. Bleſs God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:174423:51"/>eſpecially for the benefits of Creation, Preſervation, Redemption, Vocation, and for all other ſecret Benefits particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly received.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the benefits of Creation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thou waſt before thou waſt Created, even no more than very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thou waſt nothing; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could not make it ſelf any thing. Now he that drew this great Univerſe, out of the Chaos and Darkneſs of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to the light of Being and Life, it pleaſed him out of his meer Grace, to ſhew upon thee his Almighty Power, to bring thee to a being, and make thee ſomething. And (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) not every ſomewhat, not a Stone, not a Bird, not a Toad, not a Serpent, but even a Man, one of the moſt noble Creatures in the World; he made thee as a little Miracle of Nature, with the adornments of ſo many pieces well compacted together, to bear in thine aſpect the Beams of his own Majeſty. He framed this thy Body, and beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in all parts, both with Members and Senſes; and that with ſuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Art and wonderful Providence, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:174423:51"/>every one of them (if they be well conſidered) is of it ſelf a great Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a great Benefit. This <hi>Job</hi> humbly and thankfully acknowledgeth. <hi>Thine Hands have made me, and faſhioned me together round about,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Job 10.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I beſeech thee, that thou haſt made me as the Clay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Haſt thou not poured me out as Milk, and crudled me like Cheeſe? Thou haſt clothed me with Skin, and Fleſh, and haſt fenced me with Bones and Sinews,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our making and natural conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are to be reckoned among the great Benefits received from God: <hi>I will praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>for I am fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt wonders of Man's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are unſeen. God hath packt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rarities, Myſteries, Wonders, in Man's Cheſt. All the vital Inſtruments and Wheels, whereby the watch of our Life is in perpetual motion, from the firſt Hour to the laſt, are locked up in a curious internal Cabinet, where God himſelf prepared the Pulleys, hung on the Weights, and wound up the Chime, by the Hand of his Infinite Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:174423:52"/>opening of any part: As a learned Anatomiſt of ours, hath elegantly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted us in the Preface to his ſixth Book.</p>
               <p>Conſider what uſefulneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſneſs, Beauty and Convenience do meet together in every part. What Beauty is ſtampt on the Face? What majeſty in the Eye? What ſtrength is put into the Arms and Back? What activity into the Hands? What Muſick and Melody is in the Tongue? Nothing in this whole Fabrick could be well left out, or better placed, either for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for Uſe.</p>
               <p>But the excellency of Man conſiſteth in his Soul: And as Man was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Creation, ſo the Soul is the principal part of Man. God by a Divine Breathing, communicated this fountain of Life, which heavenly form without noiſe or delay, diffuſed it ſelf entire into the Body, remaining never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs whole in every part. The frame of the Body is an exquiſite frame, but the frame of the Soul, the faculties and powers, motions and operations of the Soul, are far more exquiſite. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant is more noble than the Houſe, and the Jewel than the Cabinet: And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:174423:52"/>ſo great is the capacity of the Soul, that all the things of the World put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are not able to ſatisfie it. Beſides, there is no ability, no perfection in any Creature here below, but that a Man hath the ſame in him in a higher and far greater perfection, and by the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his Soul he is able to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; whereby it is manifeſt, that God by giving us this thing alone (<hi>viz.</hi> our Soul) hath given us therewith at once all things together. The conſideration hereof, ſhould ever make thee thankful to thy moſt Gracious and Bountiful Lord, for this ſurpaſſing great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>

They are now become our Lords, and no drudgery muſt we refuſe, be it never ſo irkſome or burdenſome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about they ſhall liſt to employ us. Now, how ſhould all God's Redeemed Ones, aſcribe Honour and Glory to their God, acknowledging the infinite Love, and abundant Grace of God, in procuring Redemption for poor Bond-ſlaves, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Priſoners; that he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and anointed a Redeemer to preach Glad-tidings unto the Meek, to bind up the Broken-hearted, to proclaim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are Bound, to proclaim the acceptable Year of the Lord; to proclaim a Jubilee, a Year of releaſe to Priſoners and Bond-men! Iſa. 61.1, 2. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his Mercy endureth for ever. Let the Redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo, whom he hath redeemed from the hand

In this caſe it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe whom the Lord hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Sin, from Satan, from the Curſe of the Law, and from everlaſting Deſtruction, to wait upon their Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Redeemer, and do him all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honour, and give him all Praiſes and thankful Acknowledgments for their Redemption, procured by his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over all thoſe Enemies and Evils.</p>

And whereas thou being as unworthy of this Calling as they, yet it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to ſuffer them to continue in their Impenitency and Obſtinacy, and to call thee unto the ſtate of Grace and Salvation: Oh what thanks and ſervice doſt thou owe unto him for this ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Benefit!</p>
               <p n="5">5. There be other Benefits that are given to particular Perſons, which none other knoweth but he hath hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, for which we are bound to give thanks unto the Lord, as for the more general, for as much as they are more certain Tokens of the ſpecial and particular Love and Providence that the Lord beareth toward us. Such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits as theſe cannot be written in Books, but every one is to write them in his Heart, and ſo to joyn them with the other general Benefits, and to give moſt humble thanks unto the Lord for them. There are alſo other Benefits more ſecret which are unknown, or ſcarce obſerved by the party which doth receive them. Theſe are certain Snares
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:174423:56"/>and privy Dangers, which the Lord doth often prevent and diſappoint by his Providence, he knowing what great prejudice they might do unto us, did not he prevent them, and diſappoint them. Who is able to recount how many Dangers he hath eſcaped, from how many Temptations God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him, from how many occaſions of Sin he hath delivered him, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he hath ſtopt the paſſages, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way the ſubtile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Snares of the Devil, our vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Adverſary, that we ſhould not fall into them? Likewiſe, a Man may have many ſecret Sins, which the Perſon that committeth them, knoweth not. Wherefore as touching theſe ſecret Sins, we ought daily to pray with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Cleanſe me, O Lord, from my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins,</hi> Pſal. 19.12. Even ſo it is requiſite every day to yield him moſt hearty thanks for this kind of Benefit.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore we enter upon Prayer, or Thanſgiving, it is very requiſite, that there be firſt a Preparation of our Hearts to this holy Exerciſe; doing herein as Muſicians, who uſe to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and tune their Lute, Viol, or other Inſtrument, before they play upon it. <hi>Before thou prayeſt, prepare thy ſelf,
<note place="margin">Ecclus. 18.23.</note> leſt thou be as one that tempteth God,</hi> ſaith the Son of <hi>Syrach.</hi> In our Saviour's platform of Prayer, the Petitions are not ſet down abruptly, but a ſolemn Preface is prefixed, like a fair Porch to a beautiful Houſe, to teach us to ſet our Affections in due order, before we draw nigh to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. God hath alſo expreſly commanded: <hi>Be not raſh with thy Mouth, nor let thine Heart be haſty to utter a thing before God,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.2. It is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to babble out unadviſed and undigeſted words in his Ears. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174423:57"/>and other holy Duties call for holy Preparation. <hi>I will waſh mine Hands in Innocency, and ſo will I compaſs thine Altar, O Lord,</hi> was <hi>David</hi>'s reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6. <hi>Joh</hi> ſent and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Children, that is, he ſent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to his Children to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, warning them not to come to the Sacrifice except they were fanctified. So <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to the Elders of <hi>Bethlehem, Sanctifie your ſelves, and come with me to the Sacrifice,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.5. This Sanctifying was a preparing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, was a fitting of themſelves, that they might be ready for the Sacrifice. The very Heathen had this Notion, they would not admit any to come to their Religious Services, unleſs they were prepared, therefore they had one that cried out to the People, when they came to Sacrifice, All ye that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and prophane; go far away from theſe Sacrifices. Prepare your felves unto Prayer, by conſidering the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty of that God to whom you go to ſpeak in Prayer: For this Conſideration will teach you, with what great Humility and Reverence it behoveth ſuch miſerable Creatures,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:174423:57"/>to ſpeak unto a Lord of ſo great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as Almighty God is, concerning a matter of ſo great importance as is your own Salvation. How cloſe ſhut ought ye to have the gates of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will at the time of Prayer, from the cares and thoughts of the World, and open unto God alone, that in caſe he come to enter therein, he be not driven back again, finding the Gates ſhut againſt him, or the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Chambers taken up and peſtered with other Gueſts!</p>
               <p>And to this end you may pray to be prepared and enabled to Pray, in this, or the like manner:</p>

Make me to conſider, that Thou into whoſe Preſence I am come, and have to do, art a God clothed with Glory and Majeſty, and that I am Duſt and Aſhes, and a moſt vile and unworthy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I beſeech Thee poſſeſs me with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal reverence of Thy Glorious Majeſty, that I may watch over my Thoughts, and have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:174423:58"/>regard to my good behaviour before Thee, leſt my preſumption, and want of due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Thy Majeſty, ſhould turn my Prayers into Sin. Give me a lively ſence of my own Wants, and a clear apprehenſion of thoſe Bleſſings I have received from Thee, and of thoſe Mercies which in Thy Word Thou haſt promiſed to beſtow, that I may be furniſhed with matter both for Requeſt and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and may be able to pour out my Soul abundantly before Thee. Let Thy Spirit of Supplication ſanctifie my Thoughts, guide my Tongue, and help mine Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Give me faith in Thy Promiſes, that I may come boldly unto the Throne of Thy Grace, and let me find it is good to draw near to Thee (my God) in Prayer. Let the end of my praying be Thy Glory, and make me as ready to give thanks for Bleſſings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as to be earneſt for Mercies I ſtand in need of.</hi>

               <p>With this Preparation mayeſt thou draw near to God in the Morning, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring God for the aſſiſtance and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of his Grace, whereby thou mayſt the better beſtow the day following in his Service: And be earneſt with God in thy Preparation, to inſtruct thee how
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:174423:58"/>to do thy Duty therein, and to direct thee to ſpeak unto him in Prayer with ſuch Attention and Devotion, with ſuch recollection and cloſeneſs of Mind, and with ſuch A we and Reverence, as is to be uſed before ſo great a Majeſty; and withal, entreat him that thou mayſt ſo ſpend that portion of time in this exerciſe of Prayer, that in the end thou mayſt ariſe from the ſame with new force and ſtrength, to do all ſuch things as appertain to his Service.</p>
               <p>And that thou mayſt the better fit thy ſelf for thy Morning-prayer, go to Bed with the thoughts of it over Night; like thoſe that intend to bake Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread the next Day, do uſe to lay the Leaven over Night. So may a Chriſtian over Night, think on what he will recommend unto God the next Morning, and aſſoon as he awaketh, buſie his Mind about it, before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing do enter therein; that ſo his Heart having endited a good Matter, his Tongue may be as the Pen of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Writer.</p>
               <p>And for as much as the Prayers of the Righteous are acceptable with God, you ſhall do well to conſider in your
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:174423:59"/>Prayers both Morning and Evening, what a number of God's faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both Men and Women, in this World, be at this time at the Throne of Grace, humbly confeſſing their Sins to the Lord, and craving Pardon for them, and begging ſuch Graces and Bleſſings as are needful for them; with which Perſons you ought to joyn your ſelves, that the preſent ſweet remembrance of them, may be a Spur to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, cauſing you to perſevere in this holy exerciſe of Prayer. Moreover, whenſoever you ſhall find your ſelves cold and remiſs in this Duty, you may be aſhamed, and check your ſelves by the example of ſo many Pious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Perſons, which with ſo good care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and diligence, have continued ſo long a time in this exerciſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without ceaſing, dayly offering up their Bodies and Souls unto God in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>

               <p>AFter Preparation followeth Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which ought not to be done lightly, nor paſſed over in haſte, but with great deliberation and attention, applying thereunto your Underſtanding to conceive ſuch things as you reade, and chiefly your Affections to taſte thoſe things which you underſtand. Before you pray in the Morning, firſt reade a Chapter, or ſome ſelect portion of Scripture out of the Word of God; and when thou comeſt to any place that may enflame thine Affections, and raiſe thy Devotion, thou ſhalt do well to ſtay and pauſe a little upon it, and to make there (as it were) a ſtation in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that matter which thou haſt read, and in making ſome ſhort Prayer upon it: according to the Counſel of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is requiſite often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to gather and procure a little Spirit and Devotion out of the matters that we reade, and to break off the courſe of our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:174423:60"/>reading with ſome kind of Prayer, by means whereof we may lift up our Hearts unto the Lord, and talk with him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the ſence and matter of ſuch things as we reade do require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here let me Advertiſe, Let not thy Reading be very long, leſt it take up too much time, which ought otherwiſe to be employed: For as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is good both to reade and pray, if we can doth both the one and the other.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou haſt read a while, think with thy ſelf how many choice things thou canſt pick out of it.</p>
               <p>Conſider what holy Counſels and Exhortations to a godly Life. What Threatnings againſt ſuch Sins. What dreadful examples of God's Judgments upon ſuch and ſuch Sinners. What Bleſſings and Rewards God promiſeth to ſuch Graces and Vertues. What wonderful Deliverances God hath wrought for his Church in Times paſt, and what ſingular Bleſſings he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon his faithful Servants. Bring home theſe things to thine Heart; and do not reade them as matters of Hiſtorical Diſcourſe, but as ſo many Epiſtles ſent down to thee from God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:174423:60"/>out of Heaven; and reade them with that Reverence, as if God himſelf ſtood by, and ſpake theſe words unto thee. It is written of a certain devout and godly Biſhop, that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reade the holy Scriptures kneeling upon his Knees. And whatſoever thou thus readeſt, let it be either to confirm thy Faith, or encreaſe thy Repentance.</p>

               <p>WHatſoever the thing be that we are to meditate up on,
<note place="margin">Granat.

This manner
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:174423:61"/>of meditating ſerveth to this end, that by means of ſuch a repreſentation of theſe things, we may have the more lively conſideration and feeling of them in us. Imaginary Meditation is commonly a great help to keep in the mind more cloſely recollected, by cauſing it to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to her Work, after the manner of Bees, which work their Hony-comb within their own Hives.</p>
               <p>Some commend the Morning as the fitteſt time to buſie our minds in holy Meditations, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they find it was the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>David,</hi> that Man of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.18. ſaith he unto God, <hi>When I awake, I am ſtill with thee.</hi> That is, when I awake in the Morning, I am taken up with Meditations of God. Divine Meditations were daily <hi>David</hi>'s waking and firſt Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe then the Mind, a Man's intellectual and cogitative Faculty, is freſh, and more free from the hurrying buſineſſes of the World, which fall out every Day, and are apt to diſtract the mind in this holy Duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe if the Mind be firſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with holy Meditations, it tends
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:174423:61"/>much to keep both Mind and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in an holy frame, all the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for oftentimes what a Man's firſt thoughts are, they become his frequent thoughts on that Day. If a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Day with vain, worldly, or revengeful Thoughts, they are apt to lodg in his Heart all the Day long; ſuch thoughts are intruding and abiding Gueſts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe God reſtoreth to us his Mercies every Morning, new Mercies do attend us every Morning; and theſe renewed Mercies ſhould oblige us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our Thoughts and Meditations on God, every Morning.</p>
               <p>Thou mayſt here Meditate on Jeſus Chriſt, who is called <hi>the Hind of the Morning.</hi>] He is ſhadowed by the Hind with reſpect unto his Sufferings, for he was hunted as an Hind with Hounds, with Blood-hounds, with the Hell-hounds of this World, the worſt of wicked Men. Therefore it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in the XXII Pſalm, which is throughout a Prophecy of Chriſt, (the firſt words being ſpoken near to his Death, as he hung upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:174423:62"/>The Title of that Pſalm is, <hi>To the chief</hi> Muſician upon <hi>Aijeleh Sahar,</hi> that is, <hi>The Hind of the Morning.</hi> It is uſual for Hunters, to ſingle out that ſpecial Deer, Hart, or Hind, early in the Morning, when they intend to hunt that Day; ſignifying that Jeſus Chriſt was an Hind hunted, not only very fiercely, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early by wicked Men to Death.</p>

               <p>IT is the Honour of God, that all Creatures ſue unto him, and depend upon him, that all need his help, and that ſo many petition him for it from day to Day. <hi>He is the God of hearing Prayer, therefore unto him ſhall all Fleſh come.</hi> The higheſt Glory that God hath on Earth, is, that ſo many thouſands come daily thronging to, and knocking at the Gate of Heaven.

               <p>Our Saviour having taxed the abuſes in Prayer, ſetteth down a perfect Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where ye have, 1. A Command. 2. A Pattern. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner,</hi> or thus, <hi>pray ye,</hi>

We have ſome ſhort Prayers elſewhere, ſpecified in the New Teſtament, where we find not this Order, and therefore that I think is Arbitrary: Therefore this may have reference chiefly to the matter of our Prayers; let this be the matter of your Prayers: And to the Affection, pray with ſuch affections as are intimated in this Prayer.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Who? The Queſtion may have a double meaning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who ought to pray? To which I anſwer, <hi>All:</hi> Becauſe All owe unto God all Service, Honour, Worſhip, whereof Prayer is a ſpecial part. <hi>In him all live, move, and have their beings.</hi> Yea, Nature teaches. Man to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and ſeek to a Deity for ſupply
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174423:63"/>of its Wants. All owe this Debt, though all cannot pay it, and none ſo as is required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus: Who may, and can pray in an acceptable manner unto God? I anſwer, Only Believers. They alone can truly call him Father. They only have received him by Faith, <hi>John.</hi> 1.12. <hi>How can they call on him, in whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10. This ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the miſery of an Unbeliever, he cannot come to God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. For whom muſt we pray? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Not only for our ſelves, but for all the Houſhold of Faith eſpecially; more largely for all that belong to God, whether Called, or Uncalled; more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for all Men; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and our Liturgy after the Apoſtle, (though it be therefore taxed) <hi>ſeil.</hi> All ſorts and conditions of Men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the King, and all that are in Authority under him, our Paſtors, Church-Governours, Miniſters, all that bear Rule in the Church, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and for all the Members of the Catholique Church; for our Parents, Maſters, Children, Servants, and thoſe that be neareſt unto us, and Men that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:174423:64"/>in ſpecial do want our Prayers, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and private Calamities.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we muſt ask according to the Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Yes, according to his revealed Will: We muſt not, cannot look into his ſecret Will, to ſee who are there excluded from his Mercy; but thoſe who are excluded in his revealed Will, we muſt not ſue for; as the Devils, and thoſe who have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, if we knew them.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But do we not worſhip God in vain, when we pray for whom the Lord will not hear us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> I anſwer, No: Our Prayer ſhall return into our own boſoms, as it was with the Pſalmiſt, when he prayed for his Enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>To whom</hi> muſt we pray? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Unto God, who is there called a <hi>Father;</hi> a Word of Nature, or Perſon: In the former ſenſe taken for the Holy <hi>Trinity;</hi> in the latter for the Firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Here ye may underſtand it both ways, in a compound ſence. 1. That you are to direct your Prayers to God, the whole Divine Nature, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And then withal to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:174423:64"/>the Father firſt in order, through the Son, by the Holy Ghoſt. All are here condemned, who pray unto any other: None is to be prayed unto, but whom we may call our Heavenly Father, which is not due to any Creature.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Through whom?</hi>] I anſwer, Through Chriſt alone: For through him, and none other, is God become our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: By Him we have the priviledg of Adoption, and are made Sons and Daughters. <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, who is the Prepitiation for our Sins,</hi> 1 John 2.1. None can be our Mediator of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion unto God, but He that is the Propitiation, appeaſing him, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Wrath due unto our Sins; and therefore no Saint nor Angel muſt be employed in this Office. There is but one Mediator of Redemption and Interceſſion between God and Man, even Chriſt Jeſus, who is both God and Man.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>How</hi> we muſt pray?] <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. As to a Father. 2. As to a Father which is in Heaven. And therefore, To one that is willing and ready to help, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Majeſty and Soveraignty, ſeeing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:174423:65"/>and knowing all things, our Hearts, our Wants. This ſhould teach you to pray with Boldneſs, Confidence, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Underſtanding, Sincerity. Pray with Boldneſs, as to a Father; with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Reverence, as to an Heavenly Father; with Sincerity and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as to him that ſeeth your Hearts.</p>
               <p>The things that we are to pray for, every Morning at leaſt, one reduceth them to theſe Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> That you may not offend God this Day. That you may not want Grace, Light, and Courage, to reſiſt thoſe Temptations which moſt aſſail you, and thoſe Sins to which you are moſt inclined. That you may practiſe thoſe Vertues which are moſt neceſſary for you. That you may be guided this Day by God's good Providence, in all that concerns your Soul, Body, and Eſtate. That you may obtain new Favours and Aſſiſtance for the Neceſſities of your Neighbours, which you may then ſet before him.</p>
               <p>This kind of Supplication (among other Commodities) hath this withal, that it daily reneweth in the Soul ſome good purpoſes and deſires of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:174423:65"/>and moveth it to be the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to do that thing, which he hath ſo frequently and ſo earneſtly deſired. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, Such as pray earneſtly in very deed, will not ſuffer their Hearts to commit any thing that is unſeemly for ſuch an Exerciſe, but ever have their Eyes upon God, with whom a little before they talked, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant. And ſo by that Cogitation they put away from them all the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Devil, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what an hainous matter it were, that he that had a little before talked with Almighty God, and deſired of him Chaſtity and Holineſs, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vertues, ſhould immediately run to his Enemies ſide, and open the Gates of his Soul, to receive in filthy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Delights; and ſuffer the Devil to place him ſelf in that Heart, which a little before was the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <head>SECT. XIX. <hi>Of Offering our ſelves to God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ONe act of true Devotion, is, That a Man ſhould every Morning offer up, and make a Reſignation of himſelf unto God, which is an abſolute part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf, and a putting himſelf under the Power, Wiſdom, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, to be commanded, ordered, and diſpoſed in all things by him according to his Will. This work of Reſigning our ſelves to God, muſt be always doing whilſt we are in this World. When God hath wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart by effectual Perſwaſions,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:174423:66"/>and by his mighty Power, the Lord ſaith to the Soul, <hi>I am thy God;</hi> and the Soul anſwers in truth, <hi>And I am Thine.</hi> (As <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116.6. <hi>O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant).</hi> Now is the Reſignation actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made. But though this be done, yet it is ſtill always doing whilſt we are here upon Earth, nay, to Eternity: For it is a thing that conſiſts of an ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of multiplied Acts. As Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock is not one ſingle Act of Perſons giving themſelves each to other; but if they live as Married Perſons ought, there is a daily giving of themſelves each to other: Their Hearts go out every day with Complacency and Delight, willingly renewing the Bond, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Contract yet firmer and firmer.</p>
               <p>The end of this Reſignation of your ſelves to God, is that in all things you may be Commanded, Ruled, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him: to have the Will of God to be your Bounds, and to have it for your Rule and Pattern: To be Bounded by God, is to do nothing, but what God doth either Command or Warrant. All things are not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:174423:67"/>a Chriſtian that he may do: But Commands and Warrants are the utmoſt Latitude of that Liberty which is left us; we have no further to go, and we need not, there is ſcope enough to keep within theſe Limits. Pſal. 119.16. Saith <hi>David, I have ſeen an end of all Perfection: but thy Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, I have walked over the fair Plains of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creature, I have viewed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all Excellency in them, and I could look beyond it: But when I look upon the Commandment of God, as it is either Mandatory, or Promiſory, it is of ſo vaſt Dimenſions, ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, that it exceeds all things in the World; there is room enough for the Spirit of a Man, that is in true ſubjection unto God. Now as we need not ſtep beyond this Bound, ſo if we do, it is dangerous; it is but as a Man that ſteps out of a Way, and falls into a Pit; or one that ſteps from his Houſe, and falls into a Priſon. For this very thing God threatens <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they had withdrawn from him, that he would feed them as a Lamb in a ſtrange Place, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.16. That is, like a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:174423:67"/>Lamb not kept within its Fold and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Paſtures, under the care of a watchful Shepherd, but left to ramble at its own Will.</p>
               <p>And as to have the Will of God your Bounds, is to do nothing but what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with his Will; ſo it is to do all that he requireth. <hi>This is that which the Lord thy God requireth of thee, to do all theſe things that he hath commanded thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes.</hi> When you give your ſelves to God, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and governed by him, it is to a Subjection that is abſolute, and not conditional.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to be under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Government, is for you to make the Will of God your Rule and Pattern; Namely, not only to do the things that are commanded, but to do it in that manner as they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo be willing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by him according to his Will: To be contented in every Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſets you; and though your Caſe ſeem hard, and there is much in it that is grievous to Nature, yet lie down quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Hand and Will of God.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:174423:68"/>That's one branch of our Willingneſs to be diſpoſed by God, to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every Condition wherein God ſets us. A ſecond Branch of being willing to be at God's diſpoſing, is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Mind in reſpect of any poſſible Change, whereunto you are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Wiſdom and Will of God; as a holy Man well noteth, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. When <hi>Zadok</hi> was by the Ark, King <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Carry back the Ark of God into the City: If I ſhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it, and his Habitation. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee: Behold, here am I, let him do to me, as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> Let this be thy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, O Chriſtian: if thou owneſt God as thy Soveraign, and daily reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt up thy ſelf to be diſpoſed by him in all things, Conſider, That thou art as a Sheep before the Shepherd, that muſt change thy Paſture at the Shepherd's pleaſure; and as a Souldier, that muſt March hither and thither at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thy Captain, or General: Or as a Veſſel in the Houſe, that ſtands to be filled or emptied at diſcretion; or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:174423:68"/>as a Servant, that muſt come and go as he is bidden, and not to go to, or ſtay in any place at his own will.</p>
               <p>Let it be your care every Morning, to conſecrate all your Affections and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto God, to offer up all your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, Senſes, Thoughts, Words, and Works, and all that you are, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtom: That it is the moſt wicked Avarice, to defraud God of the Oblation of our ſelves.</hi> You may offer your ſelves to God in this, or the like manner.</p>

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:174423:69"/>
               <p>Behold, I a vile Wretch, have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended thy Divine Majeſty, I am afraid to lift up mine Eyes to Heaven; I deſire to ſtrike my ſelf with that <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> in the Goſpel, that God may be merciful to me a Sinner: I deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force my ſelf, and to take Arms againſt mine own Wickedneſs; and to judg my ſelf, that I may not be judged of the Lord. If my Bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath been ſo reproachfully han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled for my ſake; If he hath ſuffered ſuch grievous Pains and Torments for the Sins that I have committed, why ſhould not I abaſe and abhor my ſelf, being the very Perſon that hath ſinned? I am he that hath deſpiſed Almighty God; I am he that hath endeavoured to crucifie afreſh the Son of God: And me-thinks that the whole frame of this World crieth out againſt me with open Mouth, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is he that hath offended and deſpiſed our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord: This is that wicked Wretch that hath rather been moved with the guileful Baits of the Devil, than with the great Benefits of Almighty God. This is he that could never be induced to Vertue and Goodneſs, with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:174423:70"/>the Cords of Love, and ſweet enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Almighty God, nor ever be afrighted with his terrible Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and dreadful Judgments. This is he that (ſo much as lieth in him) hath defaced the Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of the Lord, and caſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them. This is he that hath been more afraid to offend a weak mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Man, than that God that can caſt both Soul and Body into Hell. This is he that hath been more aſhamed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a filthy Act before a rude Country Peaſant, than before the Preſence of the All-ſeeing God. This is he that hath preferred the Dung and Droſs of the Earth before Heavenly Treaſures. Wherefore all Creatures do cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, after this manner, and ſay, This is that lewd Caitiff that hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us all: For whereas he ought to have employed us in the Service, and to the Glory of our Creator; he hath made us to ſerve his Luſts, and the will and pleaſure of the Devil, perverting all ſuch things to the Injury and Reproach of the Creator, which he had created for his Service. His Soul was adorned with the Image of God, and he hath
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:174423:70"/>disfigured this Divine Image, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed it with our vile Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he hath been more earthy than the Earth it ſelf, more unſtable than the Water, more mutable than the Wind, more enflamed in his appetite than the Fire, more hardned than the Stone; more cruel to himſelf than the wild Beaſts, more ſpiteful and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous againſt others than the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice: He hath neither feared God, nor regarded Man: He hath not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented alone himſelf to be injurious to God; but would have many others to be partakers with him in ſinful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
               <p>Now what ſhall be ſaid of his other abominable Practices? Such hath his Pride been, that he refuſed to be in ſubjection unto God; he would not ſubmit his Neck under the ſweet yoke of his Obedience, but would rather live as he liſted, and fulfil his own Will in every point, rebelling againſt the Lord, vexing his holy Spirit. How exceedingly was he enraged, if God did not grant him all his deſires, or if he ſent any Croſſes, or Troubles, for his Trial and Exerciſe: He loved to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174423:71"/>be applauded in all his doings, whether good or bad.</p>
               <p>And now conſider, O my Soul, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Creatures may not juſtly cry out againſt thee, and ſay, Come, let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this wicked Wretch from off the face of the Earth, that hath done ſo much wrong to our Creator. May not the Earth ſay, Why do I bear ſuch a cumberſome Wretch? May not the Water ſay, Why do I not drown him? May not the Fire ſay, Why do I not burn and conſume him? May not Hell ſay, Why do I not ſwallow him up, and torment him? Alas! miſerable Wretch that I am! What ſhall I do? Whither ſhall I go, ſeeing all Creatures are in Arms againſt me? Where ſhall I hide my Head? Who will receive me, who have offended all Creatures? The great God I have deſpiſed, the Angels I have grieved, the Saints I have diſhonoured, Men I have offended and ſcandalized, and all Creatures have I moſt wickedly abuſed. Whither then ſhall Iflie for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for as much as I have made all things to become mine Enemies: I look round about me, and can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will take my part; yea, even
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:174423:71"/>mine own Conſcience barketh againſt me, and all my Bowels do accuſe me, and rent me in pieces.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, weep continually, O my Soul, lament thy wretchedneſs like a poor miſerable Creature, never ceaſe weeping ſo long as thou liveſt in this Vale of miſery! be ſtill in expectation when thy merciful Saviour will vouchſafe to turn the Eyes of his Compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee; and with all poſſible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſhame, caſt thy ſelf down at his Feet, and cry out, Oh! where can I find Puniſhment enough to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on my ſelf, and Tears enough to waſh away mine offences? O Lord, I am that great Enemy of thine, which hath committed moſt wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Offences before thy Face, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my ſelf guilty before thee. I beſeech thee, O Lord, to caſt the Mantle of thy Mercy over me, thy poor, wretched, miſerable Creature, and let the greatneſs of thy Goodneſs overcome and cover my wickedneſs. Let the moſt ſweet loving Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the coming home again of his Prodigal Son: Let the good Shepherd rejoyce at the recovery of his loſt Sheep.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:174423:72"/>Oh! how happy and joyful ſhall that Day be, when thou ſhalt caſt thine Arms about my Neck, and give me the ſweet embraces and kiſſes of Peace! I will now take Arms againſt my ſelf therefore, and be more cruel and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous againſt my ſelf than any other; I will loath and deſpiſe my ſelf, and from henceforth the face of Sin ſhall be more hideous to me than Hell; and I ſhall deſire to be deſpiſed and puniſhed of all Creatures, for as much as I have deſpiſed the Creator of them all. I am contented that all Diſhonours, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Puniſhments, do run upon me on every ſide, ſo that by them I may be brought to my moſt Sweet and Merciful Lord. And as for all Honour, Pleaſure, and Worldly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, they ſhall be quite baniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me, in ſo much as the very Names of them ſhall be heard no more in my Houſe; I will ſeek nothing elſe but the Honour of my Lord God, and the Contempt and Confuſion of my ſelf.

               <p>HEre I ſhall commend unto you the advice of a Reverend Divine of ours. Let Family-Worſhip be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſtantly and ſeaſonably, twice a Day, at that Hour which is freeſt from Interruptions, not delaying it without juſt cauſe. But whenſoever it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, be ſure it be Reverently, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and Spiritually done. If great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Duty hinder not, begin with a brief Invocation of God's Name, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his Help and Bleſſing through Chriſt, and then reade ſome part of the holy Scripture in order; and either help the Hearers to underſtand and apply it: Or if you are unable for that, then read ſome profitable Book to them for ſuch ends, and earneſtly pour out your Souls in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pretend not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity againſt any Duty, for it is but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, or negligence, that makes Men remiſs in Family-Worſhip. The lively and conſtant performance of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Duties,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:174423:73"/>is a principal means to keep up the power and intereſt of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the World, all which decayeth when theſe grow dead, ſlight, and formal.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Families wherein this Service of God is performed, are (as it were) little Churches, yea, even a kind of Paradiſe upon Earth. And for this purpoſe,

On the other ſide, where Family-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not uſed, but either for the moſt part, or altogether neglected, thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies may be termed no better than Companies of prophane and graceleſs Atheiſts, who as they deny God in their Hearts, ſo they are deſcribed by this Note, <hi>That they do not call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 14.4.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:174423:75"/>any exceeded him herein, it was only Jeſus Chriſt, the Natural Son of God, and <hi>Heir of all Things:</hi> Yet God would not that either <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, in the ſtate of Innocence, or his own Son appearing in our Fleſh, ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Calling, or idle in it.</p>
               <p>How many are there of the Gentry, that are poſſeſſed with this Opinion, that they muſt live at the height of their Eſtates, and ſpend all their time in Pleaſures and Idleneſs, no way condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Common Good, but much to the Prejudice of it; as if God, like <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> had built an <hi>Apragopolis,</hi> a City void of Buſineſs, and a Nurſery of Idleneſs and Prophaneneſs.</p>
               <p>Multitudes there are in the City, that like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> find little to do, but to buſie themſelves to hear and tell News. Others ſpend moſt of their time in Plays, and in Viſits, in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Times, Faſhions, Modes, and Compliments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> erecting (as it were) an Academy of Idleneſs, to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie all vain Perſons; like that Office ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſtiled, <hi>A Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus.</hi> But this will be the Doom of all Idle Perſons, <hi>Caſt the unprofitable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:174423:75"/>Servant into utter Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 25.30. Every one (though never ſo Great and Honourable) ſtandeth in God's Family as a Servant; as <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth himſelf to be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in all God's Houſe as a Servant, and Servants are not idle.</p>
               <p>Every one muſt ſerve in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling, wherein he muſt abide with God, whether it be in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, ruling with God, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21.) that is, for God, and being faithful with the Saints, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.12.) and ſo he muſt be a Servant unto all. Thus as <hi>David,</hi> he may ſerve his Generation by the Will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. Or whether it be in the Miniſtry, ſo he is to be a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the behalf of all faithful Miniſters, <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and our ſelves your Servants for Jeſus ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5. Yea, the Maſter of the Family muſt be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Family, elſe the Family will not abide in good Eſtate and Order. He that is idle, and neglecteth the care of his Family, is worſe than an Infidel.</p>
               <p>See that you do not only labour, but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:174423:76"/>that the thing you are diligent in, be worth your Labour; joyn Choice with Diligence, and ſee that you guide all your Affairs with Diſcretion. Meddle with nothing, till you are able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your ſelves that Queſtion, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> What is it good for? Is it my Calling, or within it? or in the way to it? Doth it prepare me for it, or quicken me in it? Doth it make me work more cheerfully, or fruitfully?</p>
               <p>See that ye do your own Buſineſs, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.11. I do not mean that ye ſhould refuſe to do Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for others if they deſire it, and that it may be for their Good; but look, that what ye do for your ſelves, or others, be confined within the limits of your Duty, Place, and Calling. Meddle not with things beſide your Calling. God furniſheth every Man with Abilities ſuitable to his Calling; becauſe therein he works for God, but not with ſufficiencies for another Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; becauſe therein he works for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or rather indeed againſt himſelf; as a Reverend Divine notes: For he that ſteps out of his Calling, offendeth God, and ſo runs himſelf into danger.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:174423:76"/>He is as a Souldier, who having his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appointed him by his General, goes to another: Or, as a Bird wandring from her Neſt where ſhe is ſafe, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth liable to be caught in Nets, to be ſhot, or made a prey to other ravenous Fowls.</p>
               <p>As Chriſtians, ye muſt ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in the firſt place, and do God's Work before your own; but in buſineſs of your own particular Calling, ſee that ye not only abide with God, as not ſtarting from him, or it; but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for God, that ſo ye may pleaſe him that hath called you.</p>
               <p>Among all Buſineſſes, ſet upon that which moſt concerneth you to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having an eye to God's Command, and the good of Humane Society: And in the midſt of outward Employments, labour to have your Converſation in Heaven; and to do your earthly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with an heavenly frame of Heart: Let not your Hearts be taken up, nor taken away with the things of the World, but ſet your Affections on things above, and not on things on the Earth. And when ye are moſt diligent in the works of your Callings, aim at the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:174423:77"/>gaining of Time and Liberty for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy to holy Duties. In your Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-days Labour, prepare for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath's reſt, and daily ſo endeavour, that you may gain time to ſolace your ſelves with the Lord, in Reading, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Prayer.</p>
               <p>See that ye manage all Buſineſſes without overmuch Cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Vexation.
<note place="margin">I have read of a certain Prince, of whom it is ſaid, That he ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways vacant in his moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Care and Diligence may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Spirit, but not ſo with Carking Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Be careful then in all Affairs committed to thee by the Lord, but vex not thy ſelf about them; for that will cloud thy Reaſon, diſturb thy Judgment, and hinder thy doing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing well. The Waſps and Droans make more noiſe than the Bees, yet make no Honey, but Wax only. So they that perplex themſelves too much about Worldly Buſineſs, perform not any thing well. And in all thy Affairs reſt thy ſelf chiefly upon God, whence all our Buſineſs ſhould begin, commit all thine Affairs unto God, truſt in him,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:174423:77"/>and have an eye ſtill unto him: [As thoſe that ſail at Sea, who that they may attain to the Land they deſire to come unto, do look more up to Heaven than down to the Sea,] then God will go along with you, and bleſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper you, that you ſhall not only get Proviſion for your own Families, but be able alſo to miniſter to them that are in need.</p>

               <p>THe Maſter of the Family is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whom reſteth the private and proper Government of the whole Houſhold, and he comes not to it by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it falleth out in other States, but by the Ordinance of God, ſetled in the order of Nature: As one hath well obſerved. To the <hi>Paterfamilias,</hi> the Father and Chief-head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the true right and power over all Matters domeſtical do belong: And to this purpoſe, if thou art in that Place,</p>
               <p n="1">1. See that thou ſet up and further the Worſhip of God in thy Family. It was the reſolution of <hi>Joſhua, I and my Houſhold will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24.15. And to this end, do thou both pray for,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:174423:80"/>and with thy Houſhold, and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the holy Scriptures, and catechiſe them in the grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they may grow in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and may profit by the publique Miniſtry. Thus God commanded the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to walk in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Deut. 6.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt rehearſe theſe things continually unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them, when thou tarrieſt in thine Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. And, ver. 20. <hi>When thy Son ſhall ask thee— What mean theſe Teſtimonies, and Ordinances, and Laws, which the Lord our God commanded you? Then ſhalt thou ſay unto thy Son, We were</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Bondmen in</hi> Egypt, <hi>but the Lord brought us out of</hi> Egypt <hi>with a mighty Hand.</hi> This Teſtimony God gave of <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law was given, Gen. 18.19. <hi>For I know</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>that he will command his Sons, and his Houſhold after him, that they may keep the Way of the Lord.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:174423:80"/>
               <p n="2">2. See that thou makeſt Proviſion for thy Family, both Food and Rayment. <hi>If any provide not for his own, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.8. <hi>The Lambs are for thy Clothing, and the Goats are the price of thy Field; and thou ſhalt have Goats Milk enough for thy Food, for the Food of thy Houſhold, and for the maintenance of thy Maidens,</hi> Prov. 27.26, 27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look that ye keep good Order, and exerciſe good Diſcipline in the Family: If Children be ſtubborn, and Servants diſobedient, you are to correct them, and chaſtiſe them according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Offence, and the ſtate and condition of the Perſon, having firſt admoniſhed them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See that you perform all Duty about your Servants conſcionably. Which conſiſteth in two things,
<list>
                     <item>I. In reſpect of your Chooſing them.</item>
                     <item>II. In reſpect of your Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the Choice of Servants, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe things.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:174423:81"/>
               <p n="1">1. As to the number of Servants, ſee that it be proportionable to your Eſtate, Revenues, Calling, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. It is great folly to make Oſtentation of many Servants meerly through Vanity. A Man is no way the happier by having many Servants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the quality of Servants, you muſt either take good Servants, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make them ſuch. If one <hi>Achan</hi> troubleth a Land, how may one irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Servant trouble an Houſe? God bleſſed <hi>Potiphar</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſakes: You ſhould beware of entertaining ſuch Servants, who have neither Conſcience, nor the fear of God, and by whoſe wicked Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Children may be ſoon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Capacity; It is neceſſary that in a Servant there ſhould be Ability to diſcharge his Office; for every one that is Honeſt, hath not Ability to undergo all kinds of Buſineſs. Our Abilities are limited as well as our Minds, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath his particular Talent, which muſt be known by thoſe that will make uſe of him. To this end enquire where they have lived, get good Teſtimony
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:174423:81"/>concerning them, and try before you truſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See that you take ſuch Servants as are faithful. Faithfulneſs is one of the Qualities which the Goſpel gives of a good Servant: You have reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and diſcreetly to make trial of it, not by ſuſpicions and jealouſies, which only ſerve to provoke ſuch as have a diſpoſition to do well. A Man is oftentimes made Faithful, by being thought Faithful; and many through continual fear to be Cozened, have taught others to Cheat and Cozen, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying <hi>their Deceit by their own Diſtruſt:</hi> As the <hi>Roman</hi> Philoſopher ſaith; You muſt allow your Officers what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and freedom their Charges do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, not quarrelling with them every minute for Trifles: Notwithſtanding you muſt carefully reſerve the ſtate of your Affairs for your private knowledg; for it is an equal Fault, indifferently to truſt all, or to diſtruſt all.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>II. As to your Carriage towards them.</head>
                  <p>When you have made a good choice, the government of them is not hard:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:174423:82"/>For St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nothing is ſo eaſie as to perſwade thoſe unto Good, who have a great deſire to put it in practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Baniſh all Vice and Scandal from your Houſe, let not Wantonneſs and Uncleanneſs come near it: Let not Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, Drunkenneſs, or Exceſs know ſo much as the gate thereof; ſuffer not proud Perſons, Liars, Slanderers, and workers of Deceit to dwell with you, cauſe froward and wicked Perſons to depart from you. This was <hi>David</hi>'s practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. For as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> made the Pages that attended on him, learn his Language; ſo the Devil teacheth thoſe of his acquaintance, his Dialect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And having exiled Vice, accuſtom your Family to ſome Devotion, cauſe them diligently to hear the Word on the Lord's Day, and on other occaſions offered; bring them to the Church, or publique Congregation, and ſee that they do there both religiouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently behave themſelves, during the time of the publique Worſhip: And that being ended, and the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſmiſſed, examine them touching what they have heard, that they may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:174423:82"/>profit both in Knowledg and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Invite them alſo to frequent the holy Sacrament, according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Capacity: Aſſemble them at the Evening, or ſome convenient time in the Day, to ſome Devout and Pious Exerciſe; ſee likewiſe how they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Behave your ſelves Wiſely and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely before your Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for your Example will do more than all your Words; the Life and Converſation of a good Maſter and Miſtreſs, is a good Monitor in a Houſe. We live in an Age wherein we have more need of Patterns than Precepts. Servants adhere to the Pillars of an Houſe, as Ivy to great Trees. It is good that ye be liberal according to your Means; in ordering your Family, be honourable in ſuch Expences as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite both for Neceſſity and <hi>Decorum:</hi> For if Nets be uſeful to take Fiſhes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is a Golden Hook to take Men. Manage your Dignity and Place in ſuch a way, as is neither, Harſh, Imperious, nor Arrogant: But let your Carriage be Mild, Affable, and Communicative: Shew Love and Tenderneſs to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:174423:83"/>A Chriſtian Servant muſt be in the place of a beloved Brother, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo to be received. <hi>Philem. v.</hi> 16. Think alſo how you may do them good, as well as how to be benefited by their Service. God required the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they ſhould not rule over their Servants with Rigour, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.43. Ye muſt temper your Power with Mercy, laying aſide threatning to your Servants, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.9. that is, Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-like, menacing of them for every Trifle: For many ſevere Maſters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes can ſcarce ſpeak to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but they muſt call them <hi>Knave, Raſcal, Quean, Drab,</hi> &amp;c. threatning to throw ſomething at their Heads, to give them that which will ſtick by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This kind of threatning their Servants the Apoſtle doth forbid. But on the other hand, take heed leſt through Indiſcretion, ye run out of one extream into another; for he that bringeth up a Servant daintily, ſhall have enough of it. Let me adviſe you alſo, to retain a decent and moderate Gravity in your Deportment, that the Stamp which God ſets on thoſe he calleth to Offices and Places of Government, may not be debaſed.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:174423:83"/>
                  <p>Finally, In all your Affairs, invoke God's Aſſiſtance, and to give you Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to know what is pleaſing to Him, and that you may put it in Execution. If your Project or Enterpriſe have good Iſſue, give the praiſe unto God, and an example of Modeſty unto your Neighbour: But if Buſineſs keep not time to your Will, learn you to keep time to the Divine Providence, which maketh all Harmony in the World; as one adviſeth: Though you may have power over your Deſigns, yet ye have no power over their Events. But above all, look into your Self, as the firſt piece of your Government; let your Conſcience be pure and peaceable, and herein do you exerciſe your ſelves, to have always a Conſcience void of offence toward God, and toward Men, ſpeaking and doing every thing with much Conſideration, and never ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or deſpiſing the Counſel of thoſe, that are able to adviſe you. Keep the thoughts of God's Preſence always in your thoughts, and teſtifie it by the deſire you have to pleaſe him in all Places, Occaſions, and Actions: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate all your Works to him before you
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:174423:84"/>begin them; and having finiſhed them, remember always to ſet upon them the ſeal of Thanſgiving due to his Divine Majeſty.</p>

               <p>Temperance muſt continually be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, no Time, never a day in the Year is allowed for Intemperance, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, or Drunkenneſs. It muſt not only be ſhunned, when Men are full of Buſineſs, or the like, but at all Times, even at Feaſts, at Weddings, at Fairs, at the meeting of old Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or the like, at ſuch times when many make account they may
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:174423:87"/>take liberty. Our Saviour alloweth thee not one hour in thy whole Life, for Surfeiting or Drunkenneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leſt at any time, your Heart be overcharged with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and Drunkenneſs.</hi> Now this Temperance in Meats and Drinks, is ſuch a ſober uſe of the Creatures, as doth not hinder, but further us in the Service of God, and in the neceſſary Duties of our Calling: Which agreeth with that general Rule of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> Theſe things therefore muſt be ſo uſed, as that they may fit you to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in your general and particular Callings. God's Glory muſt be the end of all, and all muſt be referred to it. Now if this Rule were both rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and duly obſerved, how would it guide you in the uſe of the Creatures, that you ſhould not abuſe them, nor defile your ſelves in the uſe of them. How ſhamefully do Men caſt off all due conſideration of this Rule, when partly by ſtupifying their Senſes, and clouding their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by letting looſe their Hearts to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:174423:88"/>Carnal Contentments, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unfit both for the Service of God, and for the Buſineſs of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Callings. Such Men aim not at the Glory of God, but the pleaſing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens vain humours with whom they converſe, the ſatisfying of their own carnal and ſinful Appetites, or the like, to the great Diſhonour of God, and taking his Name in vain.</p>
               <p>Labour therefore to ſhun and abhor Intemperance and Drunkenneſs, as that which will abaſe you below the Beaſts that periſh; and which as one (who in his time was eminent above the moſt in his Kingdom, for Wit and Parts) ſaith, will make a Man Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and deſpiſed of all Wiſe and Worthy Men. Take heed therefore (ſaith he) that ſuch a cureleſs Canker poſſeſs not thy Youth, nor ſuch a beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infection thy old Age, for then ſhall all thy Life be but as the life of a Beaſt; and after thy Death thou ſhalt only leave a ſhameful Infamy to thy Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who ſhall ſtudy to forget that ſuch an one was their Father. Thus he, and much more for the diſgracing of that Sin. Abridg your ſelves therefore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:174423:88"/>of ſome of your lawful Delights: For ſuppoſe it be lawful to deſire after the moſt pleaſant Food, and to feed on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Diſhes at your Tables, yet may ye do better to deny your ſelves ſome lawful Contentments, than always to go to the utmoſt bounds of your lawful Liberty, or to do all that is not ſimply unlawful. You ſhall not readily fall in things unlawful, if you warily reſtrain your ſelves ſometimes in things lawful. If one be addicted to Intemperance in Eating, he ſhall with more facility o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome this Vice, if he abſtain from thoſe Meats that are moſt pleaſing to his Palat; even ſuch as are lawful for him to feed upon, and if he abſtain from them at ſuch times as he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe them. This is one of the moſt forcible remedies to overcome this Vice, that any Man can uſe.</p>
               <p>Begin all your Refections with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and feed your Minds with holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations whilſt ye are eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, As of eating Bread in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, of labouring for the Meat that endureth to everlaſting Life, of feeding on God by his promiſes by Faith; then doth God prepare a Table

               <head>SECT. XXVI. <hi>Of Recreations, and how to uſe them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COncerning Recreations, it is the judgment of many Grave and Learned Divines, that it is an unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and unwarrantable Courſe, to ſpend a great part of a Man's time in Recreation, as if it were one half of a Man's Buſineſs, or perhaps more. It is only ſo far allowable, as it carrieth a reſpect to the Glory of God, and no more; ſo far as it is ſerviceable to a Man's Calling, and maketh him the more fit to diſcharge the Duties thereof to his Glory. I confeſs, it is neceſſary that ſometimes we recreate our ſelves, both our Bodies and Spirits; and it is too rigorous a thing not to give our ſelves any Recreation; nor to ſuffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are under our Charge, to take
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:174423:90"/>any. To walk Abroad to take the Air, to entertain the company with pleaſant Diſcourſes, to Ring, to Shoot, to play on ſome Inſtrument, or the like, theſe are Recreations ſo honeſt, that to uſe them well, needs nothing but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that gives to every thing its Order, Time, Place, and Meaſure.</p>
               <p>Many uſe the Tennis, Batoon, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, running of the Ring, Cheſs, Bowls, and Tables, which are Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions commendable enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but therein ye muſt beware of Exceſs, be it either in the time employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in the Money hazarded; for if we employ too much Time therein, it is no more a Recreation, but an Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, that neither recreates the Body nor the Spirits, but rather dulls and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts them. Beſides, if much Money be hazarded, it diſorders the Affections of the Gameſters; and it is an unjuſt thing to lay great Wagers upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and abilities of ſo ſmall Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as is the hazard of all Games. But above all, take heed of placing your Affection on any of them: For be the Recreations in themſelves never ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, it is a Vice to ſet your Affections
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:174423:90"/>on any of them. But thou mayſt take Recreation in playing for the time thou playeſt, otherwiſe it would be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; but thou muſt not eagerly deſire or long after them, nor yet ſtudy on them, nor vex thy ſelf about them. And when thy Recreation withdraweth thy Mind from walking in an honeſt Calling, or eateth up the Time which might be far better ſpent, in doing thoſe things, as might tend to the good of thy ſelf, or others, either in reſpect of this Life, or the Life to come, it is a manifeſt Intemperancy, and want of Moderation. And if ſo ſtrict an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be given of idle words at the Day of Judgment, as our Saviour tells us, how ſtrict a reckoning muſt be rendred of idle Actions? And all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sport are idle, when they are Immoderate. All Chriſtians are bound to redeem the time, not thus idly and vainly to trifle and paſs away the time. And Heaven is appointed as a place for Men to reſt in from their Labours; not for thoſe to ſit down in, who have here ſpent a great part of their days in Sports and Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Ye may ſee the lawful uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:174423:91"/>Comforts, Recreations, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, allowed to the Godly, and the ungodly Man's unlawful and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſe of living in Pleaſure, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth to us; in the difference that's between a Bird's and a Fiſh's u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Waters.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Bird doth but touch the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſips only for refreſhment; but the Fiſh wallows and tumbles in it, and delighteth to drench, and cover her ſelf therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bird only toucheth the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but reſteth not upon them, but quickly ſpeeds her ſelf away again; but the Fiſh reſideth in them, as in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Element.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Bird as ſhe flieth, lighteth down, and takes up a little Water in her flight by the way; but the Fiſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth continually ſwilling and ſucking in it.</p>
               <p>So he that lawfully uſeth thoſe things which God hath given for our Delight and Refreſhment, in a Chriſtian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate way, he takes them more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly; whereas others do even glut and cloy themſelves with them God's Children do take but a little of theſe,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:174423:91"/>and but by the way as they are in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Race that is ſet before them, as they are in their flight towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, their Souls being then upon the wing, and raiſed to Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when they do taſte of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe things. And if they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tranſgreſs, and ſometimes glut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much with theſe things, their Failing doth more trouble them, than their Pleaſure doth refreſh them. On the other ſide, He that lives in Pleaſure, as the Fiſh in the Waters, he is then at reſt when he is enjoying ſome ſenſual Delights, he is then in his proper <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> and Element, when his Heart is even drench'd and immerſed in ſome ſuch Pleaſure, as is adapted to his Senſual Affections. And when he is in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worſhip of God, he is like a Fiſh on dry Land, out of its place; he is in ſuch a Courſe as is not pleaſing to him; his Heart acquieſceth in the midſt of his Delights, being not at all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in any Heavenly Imployment, his Heart is not any way born up with any lively and Heavenly Affections.</p>

               <p>EVery one in the Family ought to ſerve God according to his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as his Place gives him occaſion or advantage. Many a one, if he were Head and Maſter of a Family, (as he is but an Inferiour) would do more good than there is done. Therefore they that have ſuch advantage of place, ſhould glorifie God accordingly: And they ſhould be like thoſe Wheels in the Clock, which move firſt of all, and carry round all the reſt with them: They ſhould be Leaders in Praying, in Reading, in Meditation, in holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in Humility, in Zeal, in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, in Admonition, in an Heavenly Converſation.</p>
               <p>Parents ſhould pray earneſtly unto God to heal their Childrens Souls. They ſhould alſo be very careful to purge out the vanity of their Hearts and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; that ſo albeit they could not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:174423:92"/>prevent the running Iſſue whereby they conveied Sin to their Children at the firſt, yet they may take heed of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it by an evil example. By a vain and evil Converſation, thou doſt no leſs than confirm, and even water thoſe roots of Sin, which thou thy ſelf haſt planted in them. 1. Evil Examples are moſt dangerous, which are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Men that have moſt Authority. Now the Child, eſpecially when he is young in his Childhood, when his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition receiveth its firſt ſhape, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon his Father as his Prince (as it were,) he feareth and regardeth more than any Prince; and ſo his Look, his Word, and eſpecially his Example, is a Law unto him, and he looks for no better Warrant.
<note place="margin">Maxima de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur pueris reverentia.</note> It hath been ſaid, Much reverence is due to Children. We ſay (and that truly) that Children owe great Reverence to their Parents and Elders: And 'tis as true; Parents and Elders ſhould carry it reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently toward Children, becauſe their Example emboldens Children to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in a likeneſs of Speech, or Behaviour. 2. That Example is moſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:174423:93"/>dangerous, that is moſt commonly in ſight. Now the Child looketh upon the Father and Mother almoſt every Day, when they riſe up, lie down, go forth, come in, talk, eat, drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is ſtill with them: Other Mens Courſes he ſeeth but now and then, theſe always. Now when unmortified, unreſtrained Vanity ſhall break out in every paſſage of their Lives, and their Children be witneſſes of it, is it not likely that they will be followers of it alſo? The Child perhaps hears a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Swear once in a Week, or Month, but when he ſhall hear his Father every Day diſhonour God this way, this is very dangerous. 3. Evil Examples are moſt dangerous in thoſe whom we ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially love; for Love is a cover for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Blemiſhes, in Perſons and Things that are beloved. Now whom doth the Child love ſo much as Father and Mother, therefore their evil Examples will foon take with them. That which is evil in Parents, ſeemeth good to their Children, becauſe of their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Love toward them. Therefore ye Parents, how careful ſhould ye be of your Carriage in regard of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:174423:93"/>Ye would have your Children love you, and ſo they ought: But take heed leſt ye make their Love to you, an occaſion of Deſtruction to them. That were a moſt wicked unnatural Parent, that knowing his Child ſhould love ſomething as ſhould poyſon it, would purpoſely lay it in his Child's way, that he might ſwallow it down: So when a Parent knows his Children love and embrace him, and that which he doeth, his Courſes and Actions; what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing is it, if he ſhall defile himſelf and his actions with Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſo occaſion his Children by embracing him in love, to take into their Hearts and Affections, their Sin and Wickedneſs alſo, whereby he and his Actions are poiſoned. 4. The evil Examples of thoſe are moſt dangerous, on whom we depend moſt. Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom on Farth doth Children moſt depend ſo much as on their Parents? They look for Meat, Drink, Clothes, Protection, Portions, from them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Examples are even a Law unto them. Therefore Parents ſhould walk unblameably before their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that their Sins may not be Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:174423:94"/>and occaſions of falling to them. 5. Thoſe Examples are moſt dangerous, which are of ſuch Perſons as have a ſpecial nearneſs and likeneſs to us in Natural Diſpoſitions. Now whoſe Natural Tempers are commonly more like, than the Child's to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's and Mother's? And when they being of like temper to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhall walk before them in a vain Converſation, this will be a dangerous means to draw them after them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye that are Parents, take heed, let not your Children learn of you to Lye, Swear, to be Drunk, to Cheat, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabbath, to ſcoff at Piety, to ſpeak Filthily, to be Malicious, to be Revengeful, to be greedy on the World, to be Proud, to be Wanton, to be Obſtinate, to be Idle, to contemn the Word of God, to neglect the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, or to perform it careleſly. It is little thought what miſchief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers do to their Children in this regard. When the poor Child not yet knowing the right Hand from the left in matters of Religion, nor what belongs to Salvation and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall ſee the print of his Father's
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:174423:94"/>foot in the way of Sin and Death, will he not be apt to make his Father's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps his Direction? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.15, 16. Fathers by giving evil Examples to their Children, give evil Statutes to their Children. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Walk ye not in the Statutes of your Fathers.</hi> This he ſpake unto the Children. Their Fathers gave them Statutes, <hi>viz.</hi> They gave them their evil Example as a Law and Rule unto them. The Lord char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to walk in his Laws, and keep his Statutes, and not to make the evil Ways and Examples of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a Rule unto them.</p>
               <p>Therefore ye Parents, be ye very careful of your Converſation, even in regard of your Children; for be you ſure of this, that if you periſh in your Sins, and by your Example bring your Children to the ſame place of Torment, every one of them ſhall add exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your Woe and Miſery. On the other ſide, in tender pity towards them, and your own Souls, labour all ye can, by Exhortation, Example, and by all good Means, to ſet your Children in the way of Life, that they may be a Crown unto you at the laſt Day. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:174423:95"/>are thoſe Parents which ſo walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Children, and bleſſed are thoſe Children, which ſo follow ſuch Parents, as they follow Chriſt.</p>

               <head>SECT. XXIX. <hi>How every one is every day to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all Opportunities of doing Good.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OPportunity is many times a ſpecial means which a Man of Gifts and Place hath to do good above others, and above himſelf at other times. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times things fall out ſo fitly to a Man, that they even put him upon ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice tending to the Glory of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others have not the like. In ſuch caſes the Rule is that which is given to one in the holy Story; <hi>Do as thine Hand ſhalt find:</hi> Do as occaſion ſhall ſerve, do as opportunity ſhall inuite thee. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are called by the Lord's Providence giving them opportunity, to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for his Glory, whereunto others have not the like occaſion. And when Men fail herein, they ſhew ſome neglect, or diſobedience towards the Lord's Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and therefore when God offers an opportunity, we muſt not ſtand a queſtioning or muttering, Why do not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:174423:96"/>ſuch, or ſuch, go before us? Why do not ſuch do it rather? As <hi>Moſes</hi> in his weakneſs told the Lord, <hi>[Send him whom thou ſhouldeſt ſend.]</hi> But every one ſhould think thus with himſelf, This is my Work, the Lord puts it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and I muſt do it. This falls out in many Caſes, for which there is not a full Direction to be looked for.</p>
               <p>Thus it may happen that a Man may ſometime by opportunity, be put upon a work of Mercy, to relieve one in Wants, when we meet him through God's Providence in caſe of Extremity, and we have ſomething at hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to help him. This was the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan's</hi> caſe, who found in his Journey the poor helpleſs Man, Robbed and Wounded, and ſo as occaſion was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he menifully relieved him. Now this Opportunity, that he came by him in this Extremity, and had ſomething about him to help him withal, did both enable him to relieve him, and was a calling to the Work which others had not, that came not that way.</p>
               <p>So again, When Mens caſes are more clearly made known to us than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by familiar converſing with them,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:174423:97"/>or by ſome other means, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpecial ſuit is alſo made unto us. So <hi>David</hi>'s caſe was ſpecially made known to <hi>Nabal,</hi> by the familiarity paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Servants in the Wilderneſs, and ſpecial ſuit was alſo made unto him by all the Rich Men thereabout; and therefore he had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial opportunity and calling to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>David,</hi> and was more ſpecially bound to it than ſome others.</p>
               <p>So ſometimes a Man ſhall have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial opportunity given him, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh another of his Sin; He may meet him alone, he may perhaps have ſome advantage of him in ſome kind, and may make him beholden to him ſome way or other, and ſo have occaſion to deal the more boldly with him. As <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſtood in need of him and his Prayer, to remove the Plagues which came ſo thick upon him, made uſe thereof, and amoniſhed him of his unfaithful dealing, and hardneſs of Heart.</p>
               <p>I have read, that when a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> was ſmitten with a moſt grievous Diſeaſe, and was forced to make uſe of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:174423:97"/>Phyſician that feared God, the ſaid Phyſician took this as an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to tell him cloſely of the great Sin, in ſhedding the Blood of his Saints, and that this Diſeaſe was God's revenging Hand upon him. And when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had made the Blind Man eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beholden to him for the cure of his Blindneſs, he took the opportunity to give him a ſeaſonable Admonition, <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when another hath need of thine Alms, thy Counſel, thine Help any way, and Opportunity is given thee to deal plainly with him for any ſpecial Sin that thou ſeeſt him lying in; ſo perhaps thou findeſt him in a better temper than he uſeth to be. Thou mayſt then think the Lord hath fitted, and made him ready to thine Hand, and given thee an opportunity to work upon him, and thou muſt think thy ſelf bound to take it. There are many Caſes, and great variety of this kind, which a Man ſhall ordinarily meet with, and which every one muſt watchfully obſerve and take for the Glory of God, and his own furtherance in the Ways and Work of God.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:174423:98"/>
               <p>Finally, All Chriſtians truly ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are enabled with heavenly Means and Graces, far above thoſe that are in their Natural Eſtate. The wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>A living Dog is better than a dead Lion.</hi> The meaneſt Chriſtian, of the weakeſt Capacity, and ordinary Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts, being raiſed to the new Life of Grace, is better able to do the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, than he that is dead in Sin, though enriched with higher natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Endowments.

                  <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, tells us a memorable ſtory, That when the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, had cauſed the Clergy to come together to diſpute about the Opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> there came unto the Aſſembly divers Philoſophers, and Logicians, that were exquiſite in their Faculty, and were highly conceited of themſelves. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt there was one that was very famous for a Logician, and every day he diſputed with the Biſhops, that were good Logicians alſo. Many very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men came to ſee and hear thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, nor could the Philoſopher be put to ſilence: Nay, ſo cunning he was,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:174423:98"/>that when he was thought moſt of all to be caught and taken, like a ſlippery Eel he would ſlide away from them. But that God might ſhew, that his Kingdom is not in Word, but in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there was among the Biſhops, one of the Confeſſors ſtanding by, a Man knowing little ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, who when he ſaw the Philoſopher inſulting over the Biſhops, and boaſting himſelf upon the skill that he had in Arguing and Reaſoning, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all that ſtood by to give him room, that he might talk with that Philoſopher. The Biſhops and their Party, that knew the ſimplicity of the Man, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs in that kind, were afraid and bluſhed, leſt that Holy Simplicity of his ſhould perhaps be expoſed to the Scorns of thoſe crafty Companions. But the Old Man perſiſted in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and thus began: O Philoſopher, (ſaith he) in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, hear thou thoſe things which are true. God that made the Heavens and the Earth, and gave Man a Spirit; whom he framed of the Duſt of the Earth, is One: He hath by the Virtue of his Word created all things both Viſible
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:174423:99"/>and Inviſible, and ſtrengthened them by the Sanctification of his Spirit. This <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> whom we call the <hi>Son,</hi> taking pity upon humane Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, was born of a Virgin, and by the paſſion of his Death, hath delivered us from everlaſting Death, and by his Reſurrection hath given us everlaſting Life, whom we look for to be the Judg of all we do. <hi>O Philoſopher,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>believeſt thou this?</hi> Whereupon the Philoſopher, as if he had never learnt the Art of Contradiction, was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the words which were ſpoken, that being mute to all that was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, only this he was able to anſwer: That what the Old Man had ſaid ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to himſelf indeed, and that there was no other Truth than that which was delivered by him. Whereupon the Old Man then replied, Why then, faith he, if thou believeſt theſe things to be true, ariſe, and follow me to the Church, and take thy Baptiſm, the Seal of this Faith. Hereupon the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher turning to his Diſciples, or to thoſe that were preſent, and came to hear, ſaid, O ye learned Men, hearken unto me; Whilſt this Matter in hand
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:174423:99"/>was performed by Words, I alſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Words unto Words; and thoſe things which were ſpoken, able I was to confute by the Art of Speaking: But now that inſtead of Words, Power is proceeded from the Mouth of him that ſpeaketh, neither can Words reſiſt that Power, neither can Man withſtand God: Therefore, if any of you here preſent, can believe thoſe things that have been ſpoken, as I do believe them, let him believe in Chriſt, and follow this Old Man, in whom God hath thus ſpoken: And ſo at length the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher becoming a Chriſtian, was glad that he was thus vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>Now then all ye that are made alive to God, conſider ye what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth at your Hands; is it enough for you to keep pace in the Ways of God, with thoſe that are aſleep, yet dead in Sin? As if a Man ſhould not ariſe from his Bed, nor ſet upon his Work, until he ſeeth the dead Corpſes in the Church-Yard riſe out of their Graves, and walk abroad. It is you that have wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to ſerve the Lord: It is you that have your Eyes opened, to ſee the Ways and Works which he hath ordained, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:174423:100"/>ye ſhould walk in them: It is you that have Faith to reſt upon him, whereby to receive an encouragement from him in his Services, upon the apprehenſion of the Crown of Glory. It is you that have the Spirit of Prayer; it is you that have caſt Anchor within the Vail; it is you that can ſee an open paſſage for your Prayers and Services to the Throne of Grace: It is you that have felt the Fire of God to fall upon your Hearts, whereby ye might offer up an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice unto God, like <hi>Elijah,</hi> whilſt Carnal Men, like the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> may beat, cut, and force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as divers of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do) beyond others in outward ſhews and needleſs Superſtitions, and yet have not one ſpark of Fire from above, to ſet their Offerings on fire. It is not a body of Sin that will make a pleaſing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, but a Body and Soul waſhed by the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore you to whom God hath thus given, you muſt offer up your ſelves to him; as our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples: <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</hi> So I ſay, To
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:174423:100"/>you it is given to pray, to you it is given to reade the Scriptures, and to hear the Word of God; To you it is given to meditate on the Word; To you it is given to ſee and conceive aright of Heavenly Things: Ye have taſted of Love and Mercy, and therefore to you it is given to ſhew Love and Mercy. Think ye of your Talents, and of your Receipts unto whom God hath given much, look what ye have received, mind your Account, tender his Glory, whoſe Love in all Eternity was ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your Souls above many thouſand others.</p>

God did not allow that great Politician <hi>Achitophel,</hi> to uſe that wit he had given him to invent, nor his Tongue which was an as Oracle, to deliver a peſtilent Counſel againſt his Anointed, a Man after God's own Heart, not to teach the Son how to kill his Father.

               <p>Some Men have notable Heads, and great Apprehenſions, but they fill them meerly with Earth, the World poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them altogether; they are wholly buſied in laying plots for Gain, or in compaſſing and graſping more of the World than they can well rule when

God hath given thee a Golden Wit, thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is a Golden Cup, and wilt thou let thy Luſts drink out of it? Or wilt thou drink thy ſelf to the Devil in it? Know thou, that Satan ſeeks to make thy
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:174423:102"/>Wit an ornament to him, and thy Parts the credit of his Court and Cauſe.</hi> The beſt Wits are fitteſt for the beſt and higheſt Employments: It is pity that Men of excellent underſtandings, ſhould be ſet to dig in the mines of baſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. They ſhould uſe them in ſearching the Scriptures, and in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledg out of the Word of God, who doth not require of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Creature that it ſhould know his Will in his Word, but of Man to whom he hath given a more excellent Spirit. But this is to be lamented, that Men that naturally have notable Underſtandings, quick Wits, and ſolid Judgments, are very blind and ſhallow in the knowledg of God's Word. How will theſe ſtand before the Lord at the laſt Day, when he ſhall ſay unto them, I gave thee a great Underſtanding, but thou kneweſt any thing rather than me, whom thou ſhouldſt have laboured to know above all things. How haſt thou buſied thy Wits? Didſt thou not think me worth thy knowledg and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:174423:102"/>to know the way to pleaſe Me, to find out the way which I had ordained for thee to walk in: Thou kneweſt how to ſpeak unto Men, but didſt not care how to call upon my Name.

Alas! all my Wit, my Craft, my Policy, now faileth me; it will not ſerve to help me with one excuſe, whereby to ſhift off the Wrath and Juſtice of God, it doth me no good now that I am to appear before my Judg.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:174423:103"/>to bring things about as well as ye can for the promoting of God's Glory: For, as the Lord doth by his infinite Wiſdom defeat, and bring to nought the crafty malicious plots of Satan; ſo alſo he would have his Children (to whom he hath given better Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and more Wiſdom than to others) to oppoſe their Wits againſt the Craft of wicked Men, and uſe their beſt skill to uphold Religion, and to overthrow the ſtrong-holds of Satan.

               <p>And as for thoſe that have not ſo good Natural Underſtandings as theſe, yet according to their meaſure they muſt uſe their Talent, for which they are accountable to the Lord: Even weak natural Parts may be excellently perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and bettered by Grace, and raiſed to an higher degree than could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; therefore none muſt give over exerciſing their Gifts, although they cannot match ſome that are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>

It is lamentable to conſider how many notable Gifts of this kind are abuſed or neglected. If a Man could look into the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſome that are naturally ſtrong and firm, ſuch as will hold Water, what ſhould a Man ſee there but Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, wanton Songs, Play-books, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, idle News and Stories, old Grudges, Wrongs and Injuries of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ſtanding, or ſome things like to theſe? Yea, many a Man makes his Memory a meer Counting-Houſe, it is as it were a Shop-book full of Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings: But it is empty of Heavenly Things; it hath let ſlip the things which he hath heard in that kind.</p>
               <p>O Man, the Lord did not give thee
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:174423:104"/>thy Memory for ſuch ends, but that thou ſhouldſt remember thy Creator, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keep holy the Sabbath-Day, remember your latter end; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that for the actions which you do in this Life, God will bring you to Judgment.</p>
               <p>Come we to ſome Perſons, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them concerning ſuch points of Faith and Religion, as they have heard many times, they remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; <hi>the thing is gone from them,</hi> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſpake of his Dream; and their-excuſe is, They are not Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd: But ask them about ſome Worldly things, which they never heard nor ſaw more than once perhaps, and they will give you a ready anſwer; the reaſon is, theſe things ſuit with them, their Hearts are towards them; theſe take with them, ſo do not the other; therefore theſe ſtick and abide by them, when the things of God ſlide away out of their Memories. Put clean Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Veſſel that hath but a little chink, and it will ſoon get out; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that which is thick and muddy is not ſo apt to leak. The Word of God (compared to Living Water in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:174423:104"/>is ſoon loſt and forgotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is pure and holy; whereas thoſe muddy things, of which we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleanſe our Memories, than keep them there, are apt to abide in us.</p>
               <p>But know ye, that the Lord who fearcheth the Heart, and every corner of it, will ſee what is in your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Affections. <hi>God is not unjuſt to forget your labour of Love,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; ſo God is not unjuſt to forget your forgetfulneſs of Him and his Truth, when he hath given you excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and ſuch as might be of great uſe in his Service. <hi>Lord, remember me</hi> (ſaith the repenting Thief unto our Saviour) <hi>when thou comeſt into thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> As ye deſire that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you for good at the laſt Day; ſo do ye remember him now and his Word, otherwiſe it will be utterly in vain for you to call for Mercy, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance at the laſt Day. Many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are now wilfully and affectedly forgetful, and it is juſt with God to puniſh them in this Life, with a final Stupidity and Sottiſhneſs, who to give ſatisfaction to their own vile Luſts, did caſt his Word behind their backs, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:174423:105"/>willingly let the Devil ſteal it away from them. Look to it in time, and take heed that you do not provoke God by a wilful Careleſsneſs, to bring upon you a fearful Sottiſhneſs. Take heed of thoſe Sins that intoxicate the Brain and the Memory, eſpecially Drunkenneſs, Filthineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How many able Bodies, active Minds, pregnant Wits, flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Memories, have theſe overthrown!</p>
               <p>But for thoſe that are forgetful by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accidental Caſualty, or natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, I would rather ſay ſomewhat to comfort them, than to reprove them. Doubtleſs many of God's dear Children are ſubject to this defect, and daily complain of their Forgetfulneſs, and how weak their Memories are to retain any good thing that they hear. — But grant it be ſo; yet perhaps thou underſtandeſt more than thou art able to expreſs; this is to be born withal. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou remembredſt the Matter, though thou canſt not remember the words of a Sermon, This makes ſome amends: Perhaps thou remembreſt it not to make Repetition of it, yet thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt it to make Practice of it; this is beſt of all. <hi>Tully</hi> commends two
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:174423:105"/>excellent Orators, for their excellent Memories, <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> but he commends <hi>Lucullus</hi> moſt, becauſe he remembred Matter, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but Words. If thou canſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Matter of a Sermon, though thou canſt not remember the Words: Or if thou canſt remember to practiſe it, though thou canſt not remember it, thou haſt the leſs cauſe to complain. But if thy Defect be as great as thou complaineſt, it may be ſome comfort to thee, that thou haſt an Heart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it: The complaining of a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is ſome eaſing of it. How many thouſands be there in the World, have their Sin lie heavy upon them, yet it is no matter of trouble to them: Ever remember, that it is a good ſign, to be ſenſible, either of the burden of Sin, or of the want of Grace. There be four things about which your Memories ſhould be daily exerciſed; <hi>your Sins,</hi> that you may daily confeſs and bewail them; <hi>Death,</hi> that ye may prepare for it; <hi>God's Juſtice,</hi> that ye may fear; and <hi>his Mercy,</hi> that ye may not deſpair.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another gift of the Mind is <hi>Courage,</hi> wherein ſome naturally go
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:174423:106"/>beyond others. Theſe Men then are bound to make uſe of this to the Glory of God. If thou haſt a reſolute Spirit, the Lord requireth that thou ſhouldſt ſhew it on his ſide, and not in oppoſition of Him and his Ways. When a Prince hath a Souldier, or Captain, of tried and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Valour and Courage, he relieth more on him, looketh for more notable performance from him, than from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have not that Spirit and Courage which he hath. So when the Lord hath given ſome Men more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution than others, he requireth they ſhould be valiant for his Truth, and not hide their Heads, and yield to his Diſhonour. It is ſtrange to ſee how ſtout Men are in their own Quarrels (right or wrong) who are afraid of every Buſh almoſt, when God's Honour is concern'd, and have no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to plead for God, or to appear for his Goſpel and Glory.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gainas</hi> the chief Commander of the Forces of the Emperour <hi>Arcadius,</hi> being an <hi>Arian</hi> Heretick, deſired one of the chief Churches in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to be aſſigned unto him for the exerciſe of his Blaſphemous Religion, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:174423:106"/>wanting Courage to deny him, (he, it ſeemeth, being too hard for him, as the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> were for <hi>David) Chryſoſtom</hi> being then Biſhop of the place, undertook to give him his anſwer in the Emperours preſence, which he did with admirable Zeal and Courage. And when he heard him propoſe his Demand, and plead Merit, and tell what great ſervice he had done for his Prince, the Biſhop told him plainly, that the Emperour's rewards had been far greater than his Merits; and that his Service to the Emperour was far below thoſe Riches and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had received; and told him withal, That whilſt he had Life, and continued in that Biſhoprick, he ſhould neither have the chief Church, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other in that City, wherein to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, and to deny his eternal Godhead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with the Father.</p>
               <p>Courage in a Chriſtian, taketh its riſe and wing from Faith. Witneſs <hi>Gideon, Barak, Sampſon, Jephtab, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, David.</hi> Heb. 11.33, 34. <hi>Who through Faith ſubdued Kingdoms,— ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Mouths of Lions, — out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:174423:107"/>were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in Fight, turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens.</hi> Much Faith, and much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and Men of little Faith ever ſhake hands with the Puſillanimous. Courage is a goodly Grace, wherein God greatly delighteth, and whom can it ſo well become as a Believer, who hath more reaſon and better ground to be Valiant, than the greateſt Spirit in the World that wanteth Faith. Thoſe falſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spies, and cowardly <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> at the ſight or news of Giants in <hi>Canaan</hi> (notwithſtanding God's Promiſe and Preſence) counted themſelves but Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers in compariſon of the <hi>Anakims, Numb.</hi> 13.33. And all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fell a howling, as if God and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had betrayed them: Whereas <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> Numb. 14.9. looked on the Giants but as Bread for one Breakfaſt for the People of God. So great is the odds between Faith and Infidelity, in caſes of difficulty.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Quickneſs</hi> and <hi>Livelineſs</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gift of the Mind, wherein there is much difference between Men and Men. Some are even naturally of lively, ſtirring Diſpoſitions, whereas others are more
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:174423:107"/>ſlow by Nature, more heavy, and not ſo ready and preſent for any thing they go about. Now if God hath given thee this quickneſs of Spirit, thou muſt uſe it to his Glory. As <hi>John</hi> was more nimble than <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo he uſed this Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Body, and came ſooner to our Saviour's Sepulchre than <hi>Peter</hi> did. So if thou haſt a more quick and active Spirit, thou muſt uſe it in out-running others in the Ways of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If a Maſter have a Servant whom he knoweth to be quick, and can travel well, he looketh that he ſhould make more haſte when he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him in Buſineſs, than one that is Lame or Sickly. So if thou art of a quick and lively Diſpoſition, the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thou ſhouldſt every Day ſhew it in his Service, and be more forward and affectionate than thoſe which are of ſlower Spirits.</p>
               <p>But we ſee that many who boaſt of the quickneſs of their Wits and Spirits, and do deſpiſe others Dulneſs, are themſelves Dull, yea, altogether dead in the Service of God: Many that go moſt nimbly about their Profits and Pleaſures, that are full of Mettle (as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:174423:108"/>they ſay) bring them to the Service of God, and put them upon any thing tending to the Glory of God, ſet them in a courſe of Holineſs, and how ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced are they? They are as if they had no Life in them, the Services of God are a deadning to their Spirits. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural quickneſs is of good uſe, when it is ſeaſoned by the quickning Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Spirit of a Man becometh fervent ſerving God, when the Heart is lively, and full of feeling in Prayer, Meditation, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwiſe it will be a means to encreaſe ſuch a Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, if being naturally quick and ſtirring, he remain ſpiritually Dull and Dead: But where activeneſs of Spirit is put forth in God's Service, ſuch a Man will not let the Fire go out, but blows up the Coals; it makes a Man put on Zeal as a Cloak, and not only to wear this Livery of Chriſt, and go in his Errand, but to mend his pace; and not only do his Work, but do it with all his might.</p>

                     <hi>Of the improvement of External Gifts, Means,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>Not onely in regard of inward Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but alſo in reſpect of outward gifts of Body or Eſtate, Men ought to ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, Health is a great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and a ſpecial means to enable you for the Service of God, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Lord hath given you Health, ſo he requireth Health to be given up to his Service. Aſſure your ſelves, the more Health ye have, the more Work ye are to do for God; and God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more of you that are Healthy, than of thoſe that are ſickly and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. When a Maſter knows his Servant to be in Health, he ſuffers him not to lie long in Bed in a Morning, but calls him up to his Buſineſs, whereas he that is Sick, ſitteth, or lieth ſtill, without a Check, though his Maſter looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p>Ye that are Healthy, be wiſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the preſervation of your Health; do not throw away your Health upon your Luſts, do not expoſe your ſelves
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:174423:109"/>to laſting Pains and pining Sickneſſes, for the ſatisfying a wanton ſenſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. The health of the whole Body is more worth than thouſands of thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Delights.</p>
                  <p>Yet how many are there that run themſelves to the Graves Mouth, and into the thickeſt throngs of deſtroying Diſeaſes, for the taking up of ſuch poor and periſhing Pleaſures? Who to pleaſe their Fleſh for a few moments in Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and Drunkenneſs, in Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Wantonneſs, bring many Days, yea, Months and Years, pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their Fleſh, and ſhorten the number of their Days, as to what they might probably have had by the courſe of Nature.</p>
                  <p>There are many others who make their Health even a priviledg unto them to neglect the Service of God, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thorow performance of God's Service never in Seaſon, till they are on their Sick-beds, and ſee Death at hand. Such are all thoſe without exception, who put off their ſerious and ſound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, until the time of Sickneſs. Health is one of the beſt outward Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for the Service of God, now when
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:174423:109"/>this is beſtowed on the ſervice of Sin, it is not without much robbery againſt God. To give unto God only the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of our Sick-beds, when he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the beſt performances of our Health, is as if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have offered the worſt Lamb in his Fold, when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his beloved Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye have no aſſurance, if ye neglect God in your Health, that he will accept your ſickly Devotions. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, if whilſt ye have Health, ye dedicate that to God, then when Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall come, ye may be aſſured, that the Lord will accept your weak, becauſe ſincere endeavours. God will then ſay, ſuch a Man ſerved me in his beſt Health, when there were no apparent ſigns of Death near him; he remembred me his Creator before the evil Days came, therefore now I receive him as mine own, and I will make his Bed in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I will ſupport and ſtrengthen him, I will cheriſh him now in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as I accepted him hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Health.</p>
                  <p>They alſo that are Sick muſt think of the Service of God when Health is gone. The want of Health, and vigour
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:174423:110"/>of Spirits, muſt needs be a great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage where-ever it lighteth; yet where Grace is, and ruleth, the Heart is lifted up to God, the Soul breaths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and his bodily Infirmities are an help to Mortification, to Patience, to the neglect of Worldly Things, and a provocation to long for his Salvation, as old <hi>Jacob</hi> did upon his Death-bed. <hi>David</hi> attained to the beſt temper and meaſure of Spiritual Health, when he was moſt overlaid with Bodily Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Health we may joyn Bodily Strength, which is a great help to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Aſſaults, which work more upon Weakneſs, Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than upon others, in whom Nature ſanctified, can afford more helps to the inner Man aſſaulted by Frowardneſs, Timerouſneſs, or the like; as one well noteth. Young Men have more ſtrength than others over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn by Age; and if they have the Word of God abiding in them, they are ſtrong indeed to overcome the evil one. Many Men out of their ſtrength of Body might ſpare more time from their ſleep to ſpend in Religious Duties, which others of weaker and feebler Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:174423:110"/>cannot ſpare, who if they ſhould miſs of ſufficient refreſhment in this kind, would be unfit for any holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Many occaſions alſo may the ſtrong take in travel for the doing of many good Services, which cannot be ſo well performed by the weaker ſort: Yea, ſuch Men may wreſtle the more earneſtly with God in Prayer, and in performing other holy Exerciſes may be the more vehement, which weak Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are unable to perform.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſad to ſee wicked Men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their bodily weakneſs, to be never the weaker Servants of Sin. The Adulterer rolls over his ſin in his Heart, though diſabled by his own Wickedneſs as well as by Age, from the actual committing of that Sin; he is a filthy perſon ſtill, as in his greateſt bodily vigour, and a greater teacher and provoker of others to the ſame Wickedneſs. So Witches, and other envious Perſons, Malice in them ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the defects of natural abilities, or want of power or opportunity: And rather than fail, they ſummon in Satan to aſſiſt them in their helliſh deſigns. So others in time of their Weakneſs,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:174423:111"/>grow more croſs and froward to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and being more impatient, do murmur againſt God, and are ready to Curſe and Blaſpheme, becauſe they have not Health, Limbs, Strength, as well as others. Theſe are not unlike the Vaſſals of Antichriſt, juſtly ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordinary Plagues for their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Slavery, <hi>That gnawed their Tongues for pain, and blaſphemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their pains and their ſores, and repented not of their deeds.</hi> Rev. 16.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>But the weakeſt Body muſt labour to be ſtrong in Spirit, that the power of God's Spirit may be manifeſted in its Weakneſs, whilſt the inner Man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day, though the outward Man decayeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Youth alſo is an advantage in the Service of God: Young Men have more abilities and helps than Old Perſons, their Wits being freſh, their Affections lively; all the powers of Nature are then in their prime, and God requireth more of them in regard of outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Let young Men now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator in the days of their Youth, and the prime of their Days,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:174423:111"/>
                     <hi>[while the evil days come not.]</hi> The days of Old-age are evil Days; but thou muſt ſerve God in thy beſt Days: give him not the dregs of thy time, let him have the principal and choiceſt of thine Age; think thy beſt days not good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. <hi>The Years will approach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou wilt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them.</hi> Doſt thou think God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and take pleaſure in that Age of thine (if thou then begin to ſerve him) when as thou thy ſelf canſt find no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it? The Lord is to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with gladneſs of Heart for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things; and wilt thou hope to ſerve him, and be accepted of him, if thou begin not till then, when thou thy ſelf ſhall take contentment in nothing, when Old Age ſhall take away the joy of thine Heart, and comfort of thy Life?</p>
                  <p>Yet muſt the Aged labour to excel in a ſettled Conſtancy, in Gravity, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Examples, in ripeneſs of every Grace and holy Affection. But the Younger ſort muſt do more than the Aged can do, in regard of the exerciſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that in many reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So alſo in reſpect of outward
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:174423:112"/>Eſtate, and therein in regard of Wealth; <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Subſtance, and with the firſt-fruits of thine Increaſe,</hi> Prov. 3.9. St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy, Charge them that be rich in this World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they do good, that they be rich in good Works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good Foundation againſt the time to come.</hi> Where ye ſee the Lord requireth an open Hand and Heart in them who are enriched with outward Bleſſings. Every one is to lay by him, as the Lord hath enabled him. There be many things here required of the Rich, which the Poor cannot do, as to maintain the preaching of the Goſpel, where Means are wanting; to relieve the Poor and Needy; to ſtrive againſt the danger and deceitfulneſs of Riches; in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and enjoying theſe outward things, to be as if you poſſeſſed them not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ready to leave all for Chriſt, as they that have leaſt; and to be ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your portion of Wealth, to ſet forth the Glory of Chriſt; to make Riches the fuel of your Graces, and the inſtruments of your Duty towards God and Man. To have the Houſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:174423:112"/>full of Riches, and the Heart full of Grace, this is an happy Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſeth matter of great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It is an evidence of much Grace, when a Man is very holy in the midſt of abundance of outward Riches. As <hi>Pineda</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Job:</hi> That the holineſs of <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exingentibus</hi> Jobi <hi>divitiis valdè locuple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur ejus ſanctitas.</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda.</note> was enriched by his great Riches. But uſually Riches do impoveriſh the Soul, and devour all care of Heaven; they make Men to forget God, yea, to kick and ſpurn againſt him, as it is ſaid of <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run.</hi> They are often made the Bellows of Pride, the fuel of Luxury and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, the inſtrument of Revenge, and cauſe their owners to contemn, deſpiſe, and oppreſs their poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and to make no other uſe of them, but to ſatisfie their Luſts, and clog their Souls, faſtening them to the things below.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hereunto we may add Reſpect and Eſteem from the World: wherein ſome Men have a greater part than others, and (if they would rightly uſe it) a greater advantage to glorifie God; and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:174423:113"/>ſo accordingly the Lord requireth more at their hands, than can well be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, Some have favour with great Men: So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had with the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, and he might be bold to ſpeak for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the Lord, when it lay deſolate; and ſo he did. An ordinary Iſraelite had not the like opportunity. This ſhall be laid to the Charge of many, who being in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with great Princes, and ſeeing many things amiſs, will not make uſe of this their Intereſt, nor glorifie God according to thoſe Means, Advantages, and Opportunities which they have. Many ſuch might be heard if they would ſpeak, and have many fit times to ſpeak, which others have not. So many a Man hath ſome ſpecial relation to ſome inferiour Magiſtrate (ſuppoſe a Juſtice of Peace, or ſome other) he might prevail with him perhaps for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſome Abuſe, for puniſhing of ſome ſcandalous Sins, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and continued in deſpight of the World; he might ſpeak in ſome poor Man's caſe, and ſpeed too: He might prevail in the behalf of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:174423:113"/>and faithful Perſon, that is like to be trodden under foot by one that is mightier than he. Such Advantages ſhould be improved.</p>
                  <p>So even the Favour of the Multitude is many times an help to a Man in ſome caſes, for the furtherance of God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A Man being gracious with them, may ſometimes draw them from ſome ſinful Cuſtom, over-ruling them in ſome ſort, and perſwading them againſt ſome ungodly Courſe. But commonly Men that are thus in favour with the Multitude, as they got their Love by fawning upon them, humouring them, and ſaying as they ſay; ſo they will ſeek to keep it by the ſame means, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let God loſe his Honour for them, than they will adventure to loſe the good will of the People, by croſſing them in any degree.</p>
                  <p>How may you ſee thoſe Men that can do any thing with the People, to make uſe of them for their own ends! they can carry any Buſineſs, and it is their glory. But if it cometh to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that concerneth the Glory of God, the reforming of ſome ſinful Abuſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein God is diſhonoured. Theſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:174423:114"/>great minions of the Multitude, ſtand ſtill with their hands in their Boſoms, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> they care for none of theſe things. Yea, it were the more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable if that were all: But themſelves many times are the moſt dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of the miſchiefs done by the Multitude; they either ſet them on work, or elſe countenance them in their wickedneſs, and let them know ſo much of their mind, that they find them pleaſed with their doings.</p>
                  <p>That Town-Clerk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt many ſuch, who though he were an Idolater, and ſubſcribed to their Cry, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians; yet he uſed his beſt endeavours to ſtay their Rage, and to ſtill the Uproar which they made againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Fellows. So <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> (though a Maſter-<hi>Phariſee)</hi> yet ſhall condemn many others, who wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peaceably prevented the danger of the Apoſtles, being one that had great Authority among the People. And to him (ſaith the Scripture) they hearkened.</p>

               <head>SECT. XXXI. <hi>Of Holy Watchfulneſs againſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MAN is the only Creature whom Satan hunts and purſues, of all Creatures: It concerns us then every day to have an eye unto Satan, that although he purſue us, he do not make a Prey of us. Ye will think it ſtrange perhaps, that ſeeing God would redeem his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the hands of Satan, he would notwithſtanding give ſo much liberty to Satan, in the purſuing and tempting of them. But let no Chriſtian think ſtrange of it. He did not only permit it for the exerciſe of his Children, that with the more Conflicts they might have the greater Glory, and Satan the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Foil.</p>
               <p>Our condition in the World, is much like the condition of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> When they came firſt into <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is ſaid, When God had brought them thither, he ſuffered divers of the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill in the Land, and would not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:174423:115"/>drive them out all at once, becauſe he would keep his People in Exerciſe, and not have them live there Slaviſhly and Slothfully. And it is certain, that they were often Prickles in their Eyes, and Thorns in their Sides. God deales ſo by us. He hath redeemed his <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Satan's hands, brought them out of a ſtate of Sin, into a ſtate of Grace, as out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet ſtill he ſuffereth the <hi>Jebuſite</hi> to dwell in our Coaſts: He ſuffers Satan, the enemy of our Peace, by his aſſaults and temptations to vex and trouble us, becauſe he would have us held in Exerciſe, and be ever care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do as they did, to keep our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons by our Sides, that when we meet with any Affronts, we may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>How much doth it concern every Chriſtian, with all the Policy and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he can, to avoid the Oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Satan, and to get reſcue from the danger of his Aſſaults. He is in a deſperate Eſtate, that knoweth he hath an Enemy, yet is careleſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for him.</p>
               <p>It concerns you then to be at no time
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:174423:115"/>ſecure, but to be very watchful over your ſelves in all Places, in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at all Times. Ye are in the midſt of Devils, that watch all opportunities to draw you to Sin, that endeavour your Deſtruction. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> was lull'd aſleep in the lap of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> then the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came upon him. Whilſt Men ſlept, the envious Man ſowed Tares. <hi>Watch and pray</hi> (ſaith out Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> Whilſt we are praying, we had need to be watching, for whilſt we are praying we may be tempted. I may ſay too, Watch, and hear the Word of God; watch, and Meditate; watch in thy Study and Cloſet, watch and work in thy Shop, watch and walk in the Field: keep a Watch when thou art alone, watch over thy ſelf in all Companies, Times, Places, Duties; expect Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, be watchful that ye ſtumble not, and fall.</p>
               <p>The Devil is watchful to tempt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in tempting, ſubtil in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; thy Corruptions are ſtrong, thy Heart prone to be enſnared with the Charm of the Charmer; and thou knoweſt not at what time he will come
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:174423:116"/>to tempt thee. Be watchful over theſe four things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Over thy Thoughts. In all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keep thy Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. Sin moſt of all begins with Thoughts: Cleanſe thy Heart from evil Thoughts: kill theſe Conceptions, before thy Thoughts bring delight: And then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light brings in deſire to commit, and thy deſires will put thee upon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Watch moſt where thy greateſt Weakneſs is. The greateſt Watch is kept, where the Enemy is moſt likely to make Invaſion. The ſtrongeſt Watch muſt be ſet at the weakeſt part of the Walls of a beſieged City. Be ye watchful over that Luſt to which you are prone, whether Pride, Paſſion, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet your Watch there. Remember that Satan is moſt of all buſie with your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Corruptions; he loveth to caſt his Angle into ſuch waters where the Fiſh bite moſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be watchful over your ſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vanquiſhing of Temptations, for then thou art apt to grow ſecure. Although ye may by reſiſting put the Devil to flight, yet he returns again,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:174423:116"/>and will as violently aſſault you as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Lord will ſhortly tread Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan under your feet, but he ſtands his ground for the preſent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be watchful after thy Falls, leſt a worſe Temptation than a former befal thee. If Satan ſeeth a Man ſtumble and fall, he will keep him down if he can. When he had drawn <hi>David</hi> to commit Adultery, he put him upon Murder. When he had made <hi>Peter</hi> to deny Chriſt once, he proceeded in his Temptations.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Here let me propound divers Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt Temptations, that ye may not be overcome by them.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Preſerve in thy Heart ſettled thoughts of God's Omnipreſence. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> would have Men to think upon grave <hi>Cato,</hi> that he was always behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to keep them from Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If the preſence of a Man, then much more the Preſence of God will keep a Man from Sin. Wicked Men take liberty to Sin, becauſe they ſay, <hi>Tuſh, Thou God ſeeſt us not.</hi> But God looks upon you, not only when you are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:174423:117"/>Faſting, but Feaſting; not only when you are Praying, but Playing; not only in the Fields, but in the Houſe; not only in the Parlour, but in the Bed-chamber, yea, in the Cloſet. Were this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſtill in you, <hi>God ſeeth us;</hi> what Temptation could prevail againſt us? It is ſaid of an holy and reverend Man, that he had this written before his Eyes in his Study, <hi>Sin not thou, though never ſo ſecret: God ſeeth thee, and the Angels ſtand by thee; the Devil is ready to accuſe thee; thine own Conſcience to give evidence againſt thee, and Hell-fire to torment thee. Be thou in the fear of God all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Maintain in your Hearts thoughts of the ſtrict account which ye ſhall one Day make of every Sin: Anſwer all Temptations thus; Oh, I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the Sins I have committed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready! And ſhall I now make work for the great Day? Is not mine account great enough already? Oh! How can I anſwer God for one of a thouſand Sins that I have already committed?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let the Word of God dwell plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly in your Hearts. To hide the Word in your Hearts, is the way to be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:174423:117"/>kept from Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. Chriſt by Scripture vanquiſhed the Devil, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Satan: It is written,</hi> Thou ſhalt not do thus or thus. Set home the Commands of God, the Threatnings of God, the Curſe of the Law upon thy Soul, whenſoever thou art tempted to Sin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Oppoſe Eternity of Torment to thy ſinful Pleaſures, and ſay, What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is it to win the whole World, and loſe my Soul for ever? What! ſhall I adventure to lie under the Wrath of Almighty God for ever, for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany Pleaſures? Profits and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are the guilded Baits of all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lodg holy thoughts in your Hearts, and obey all motions of God's Spirit. A Mind fraught with holy thoughts, will not admit vain thoughts.
<note place="margin">Intus exiſtens prohibit alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> When Satan finds the heart void and ſwept of good thoughts, then he enters with evil Suggeſtions: So whilſt thou art following the motions of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this will quench diabolical motions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Pray fervently and frequently, that God will be thy Guard: Complain of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:174423:118"/>to God, that thou art in the midſt of Enemies, always vexing and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thee. Thou canſt go no where, but the Devil is at thy right Hand: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Lord that he will rebuke Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: If God be thy Shepherd, he will reſcue thee out of the Paw of the Bear, and out of the Paw of the roaring Lion.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Let me adviſe you, to take heed of throwing your ſelves into the Lion's Mouth, and into the Paws of the Bear: It is a provoking tempting of God to give us over. If Children will be medling with Fire, it is wiſdom in the Parent to let them burn their Fingers, to prevent greater miſchief. No Man hath need to tempt the Devil to tempt him to Sin, He is watchful enough to devour; when a Man ruſheth upon Temptations, he tempts the Devil to tempt him; when a Man will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon keeping company with the Wicked, he tempteth the Devil to tempt him.</p>

               </head>
               <p>DAily exerciſe your ſelves in the work of Mortification of Sin. As the Poets write of that many-headed-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Hydra,</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> encounter'd with; that ſtill the more Heads he cut off, the more did repullulate, and ſpring up in their rooms: So we ſhall find it true of that uncouth monſter of Sin that is bred in our Natures, the more Corruptions and Temptations we van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and ſubdue, the more will multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply upon us ſtill, and re-inforce their Aſſaults. It will be every Days-work, and all our Lives-work to mortifie all our Sins. We muſt take all our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies that we can light on, and give Quarter to none that we take in Battel, putting them all to the Sword; as God commanded <hi>Saul</hi> to deſtroy All the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> And ſo careful ought every Chriſtian to be, to rid the Field of All, that he muſt ſtand armed in the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:174423:119"/>Field, after he hath beaten and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed all that appeared, and prepare for ſuch as are undiſcovered. As <hi>David,</hi> that endeavoured not only to ſubdue all his known Sins, and to be kept from preſumptuous Sins, but prayed alſo to be cleanſed from his ſecret Sins: Not from thoſe which he cheriſhed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly (for of this ſort he had none) but which he had not yet diſcovered in himſelf, or not underſtood to be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Labour ye by the power of Grace, to charge through and through the whole body of Sin, that ye may caſt down not only the Actings, but the very Imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it ſelf againſt the Knowledg of God, and bring into captivity every thought to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt. Leave no Member un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, no Sin unſubdued, even when the reliques and remains of Sin be not wholly grubbed up.</p>
               <p>Let every Chriſtian every day endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to mortifie all his Corruptions. By endeavouring to do it, ye ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thus much, that though Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth grow in your Nature, yet it ſhall not overflow in your Nature. A
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:174423:119"/>quick-ſpringing Well, that hath Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continually bubling and riſing up in it, yet being continually la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out, and emptied ſtill as faſt as it fills, the Current of it though it be not kept dry, yet it ſhall be kept ſhallow, and not ſuffered to ſwell above the Banks. So it is with our Nature; it is a Well that hath a quick Spring, there is filthy Water that ever bubbles out of it, but let us ever be pumping at it, and lading it out, now ſome, and then ſome, that as faſt as it fills, we may empty it; this will be a means to keep it ſhallow, though we cannot keep it dry, that it ſhall with no great danger ſwell above the Banks. St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Leſſon is plain, Rom. 6.12. <hi>Let not Sin reign in your mortal Bodies:</hi> Though Sin remain there, yet let it not reign there, at leaſt not reign like a King, though it reign like a Tyrant, that we ſhould be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Luſts of it. There if it will be, let it be like a <hi>Gibeonite</hi> to an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> a Drudg, a Slave; not a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> but an <hi>Hagar;</hi> a Servant, not a Miſtreſs; let not Sin loſe ground in one place, and gain in another. <hi>Mortifie your earthly Members,</hi> Col. 3.5. or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:174423:120"/>Draw mortifying Vertue daily from the Death of Chriſt, and that will have its influence upon the whole Old Man within you, although perhaps ye employ it more eſpecially againſt ſome particular members of the body of Sin: As when Chriſt curſed the Fig-tree, in more ſpecial reference to the Branches that bear no Fruit, the whole Tree im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately withered. This mortifying Vertue will not only tame, and bring under all Sin in you, that it cannot domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer and rage as formerly it did, but it will receive its mortal Wound, languiſh and conſume away more and more, <hi>Nullis medicabilis herbis,</hi> as being paſt all recovery; and haſten not only to a Diſſolution, but alſo as it were to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Annihilation.</p>

               <p>LAbour every Day to grow more and more in the Knowledg of Chriſt. Now there are two degrees of the Knowledg of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:174423:120"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Hiſtorical, or Doctrinal.</item>
                  <item>2. Experimental, and Effectual.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. As to the former, it is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Perſon, Natures, Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Offices of Chriſt, Prieſtly, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Prophetical, as theſe things are laid down in the Hiſtory and Doctrine of the Goſpel. And theſe contain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of glorious Myſteries, and wonderful Revelations, which all the Wiſeſt Men under Heaven could never have found out, no nor the holy Angels of Heaven, if the Lord himſelf had not revealed them by his Spirit. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt grow in the Knowledg of theſe. But an Hiſtorical Knowledg, or a bare Underſtanding of theſe things is not enough, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>though a Man had all Knowledg,</hi> that is, of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or kind. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour for an inward experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledg of Chriſt, and to encreaſe therein. With St. <hi>Paul,</hi> count all things but loſs for the excellency of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt Jeſus; labour daily to know Him, and the power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:174423:121"/>and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, and to be made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Death. Our Underſtandings are very weak, and it is but little that we can diſcern at one view; we have but weak and childiſh Capacities in reſpect of Heavenly Things, therefore we muſt endeavour to grow more and more in the Knowledg of Chriſt. Moreover, there is an admirable Depth in the Myſtery of Chriſt, and you can never come to the bottom of it, although ye ſhould be diving into it all your life long.</p>
               <p>Look over all the objects of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and can ye find a more pleaſing, a more joyous, a more comfortable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſtudy, than the Knowledg of Chriſt, and his Love towards Sinners? What St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of the Joys of Heaven, <hi>Tanta eſt dulcedo;</hi> ſo great is the ſweetneſs of it, that if God ſhould let fall one drop of Heaven's Joy into Hell, it would turn Hell into Heaven, it would turn the Lakes of Brimſtone into Rivers of Joy; we may ſay as much of the Knowledg of Chriſt, and of his Love towards us: So great is the ſweetneſs of it, that it can turn an Heart full of the ſorrows of Hell,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:174423:121"/>into an Heart full of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>The more inwardly ye grow acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chriſt, the more ſhall ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Him, and admire Him. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> knew <hi>Solomon</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſhe admired him ſo far, that ſhe took a long Journey to viſit him; but when ſhe was an Eye-witneſs, and an Ear-witneſs of his Glory and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhe admired him much more. So when a Chriſtian hath ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Chriſt, he admireth and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him, but when he groweth more inwardly acquainted with him, he ſeeth much more cauſe to admire and love him. Such is the inward Excellency, Sweetneſs, and Perfection of Chriſt, that the nearer any one approacheth to Him, the more Admirable and Lovely he appeareth. The more ye grow in the Knowledg of Chriſt, the more will your love of the World, of your Selves, of your Sins, wear away, and die in you. If ye find your Souls to increaſe in the Knowledg of Chriſt, ye will find your Beloved ſo far to ſurpaſs all other Lovers, that ye will grow more and more out of love with them. Labour
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:174423:122"/>ye daily more and more to partake of the comforts of his Spirit, for Chriſt will ſhine forth brightly in theſe to your Souls. This Comfort is called, <hi>The Light of his Countenance,</hi> (Pſal. 4.) and therefore as the Light of the Sun ſheweth the Sun unto us, ſo that we ſee it by its own Light: So the Joys and Comforts of Chriſt's Spirit, (which are the Light of his Countenance) do diſcover Chriſt in a clear and excellent manner to Believers. Theſe ſhew Chriſt in his Beauty, and make the Soul to admire him, and cleave unto him. The darkneſs of Hell it ſelf cannot hide Chriſt from you, when he doth thus diſcover himſelf unto you by his own immediate Light.</p>
               <p>Labour alſo daily to grow in Grace. <hi>Creſeens</hi> is a fit name for a Chriſtian, becauſe he ever is, or ought to be in a growing ſtate; Grace having the ſame efficacy upon the Soul, as the Soul hath upon the Body. Whilſt the Body is in a growing condition, the Soul enlargeth the Body in all the parts and dimenſions, that the Members may not only fill more Clothes, but take in more Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and ſo become ſtronger
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:174423:122"/>and more ſerviceable. In like manner labour ye, that your inner Man may truly grow up in Chriſt, in all things by the working of the Spirit of Chriſt, as the ſoul of that new Life that is within you, that ye may be meet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Righteouſneſs, to bring forth Fruit unto God. Be ſtill advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, ſtill aſcending, always going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto Perfection, not only in Knowledg, but growing in ſolid Grace; not in external Profeſſion and Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but in all good Works, which are more and better at the latter end than at the firſt. Endeaſour to be ſtill on the thriving hand, that ye may bring forth more fruit in old Age, than at the beginning; that ye wither not, nor decay, but ſtill be fat and flouriſhing: And this may be your comfort, although the outward Man decay, yet your inner Man is renewed day by day. And when ye cannot perform ſo much outward ſervice, as when younger and ſtronger in Body, yet your thriving Soul will glory more and more in your God, even to ſee others to ſtand up in your ſtead, whom by holy Counſel and fervent Prayers, ye may further in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:174423:123"/>
               <p>Labour every Day to grow more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſee that your Knowledg become more judicious, your Zeal more diſcreet; your Love more active and ſubſtantial; grow more to God, and leſs to your Selves and the World; ſettle your ſelves more and more in a good Courſe; and although ye ſeem not ſo fair outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet inwardly labour to be ſound at Heart.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:174423:124"/>Eyes of Diſcretion, to accommodate circumſtances of our Speech, as Times, Places, Perſons, Occaſions do require. They that are affected with Loquacity and much Speaking;

               <p>There is Fooliſh-talk alſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us not, and that is curiousmed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with other Mens Buſineſs. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13.

               <p>Let all therefore, but eſpecially thoſe that ſeem to be Religious, take ſpecial care every Day to the well governing of their Tongues, to bridle their Tongues. A Bridle hath a Rein belonging to it, and a Bit; the Rein to give Liberty, the Bit to Check in. Thus learn ye to do by your Tongues; you muſt learn when to give them the Rein, when the Bit; when to let them looſe, when to reſtrain them. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is a time to Speak, and a time to keep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> To this purpoſe there are divers Circumſtances, which are carefully to be obſerved of us, both in our keeping Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in our Speaking. We muſt conſider,
<list>
                     <item>The Perſons, to whom we ſpeak.</item>
                     <item>The Matter, what we ſpeak.</item>
                     <item>The Manner, how we ſpeak.</item>
                     <item>The End, why we ſpeak.</item>
                     <item>The Place, where we ſpeak.</item>
                     <item>The Time, when we ſpeak.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:174423:128"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Perſons are to be conſidered, to whom ye ſpeak; for you muſt not ſpeak every thing to every Body. To ſome it were a folly to do it; to ſome it were dangerous to do it; it were like <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s opening his Treaſures to his Enemy, which was little better in effect than the betraying of his Kingdom. Obſerve the Condition and Quality of the Perſon, and accordingly learn to ſpeak, or to be ſilent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve the Matter that ye ſpeak of; for according to that, ye ſhould ſpeak more freely, or more ſparingly. <hi>My Heart is inditing a good Matter,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>and my Tongue ſhall be the Pen of a ready Writer.</hi> If it be a good Matter that we are to ſpeak of, we may let go the Rein of the Bridle, and give our Tongues more ſcope and liberty: But take heed <hi>of thoſe prophane Bablings</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>that increaſe to more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.16. Thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Bablings that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, to meddle as Buſie-bodies in other Men's Matters, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> gives good advice to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>Thou wilt not give thy Stomach bitter Meat to feed on: and wilt thou give
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:174423:128"/>thy Tongue wicked talk to feed on?
<note place="margin">Cibos ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritudinis non das ventri, &amp; cibos Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, dabis Linguae, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi>
                     </note> As thou art choice of what thou Eateſt, ſo be choice of what thou Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve in what Manner ye ſpeak. St. <hi>Paul</hi> would that all your words be ſeaſoned with the ſalt of Diſcretion, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. You muſt learn when to uſe an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, when a Reproof, when a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. If ye be to deal with a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, uſe the more Humility; if with one Equal, you may uſe the more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; if with your Inferiour, ye may exerciſe your Authority. Some Natures muſt be handled with Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome with Sternneſs: Some Faults are to be privately reproved, others to be publickly rebuked. Some Offenders muſt be ſaved with fear, others reſcued with Violence, and as it were with plucking out of the Fire. According to the ſeveral Occaſions and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that we meet with, ſo muſt our Speech be tempered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider what end ye have in ſpeaking: For though your Mouth be as the Oracle of God, ſpeaking things
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:174423:129"/>Heavenly and Excellent: Though your Admonitions be never ſo holy, your Conſolations never ſo refreſhing, your Reproofs never ſo zealous, yet perhaps your End may not be ſincere. Let your End therefore be always to aim at the Glory of God, and at the good of your Brethren; Piety teacheth the one, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider the Place where ye ſpeak; for there is a difference to be put between private Places and publique. A Sage Philoſopher ſitting at a Feaſt, was by ſome of the Gueſts requeſted to enter into ſome Philoſophical Diſcourſe; he anſwered, <hi>Inter pocula non eſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phandum:</hi> That was no fit Place for him to diſcourſe of Philoſophy. Some will never talk of Religion, but when they are in a Tavern, or upon an Ale-bench; fit Chairs for ſuch Doctors. I do not ſpeak as if God might not any where be talkt of; I ſpeak only to condemn the indiſcreet Folly of thoſe, who chooſe unfit Places, or unfit Meetings for their Diſcourſes: It is to do as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, to pray in the Market-place, and to buy and ſell in the Temple.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:174423:129"/>
               <p n="6">6. You muſt have reſpect to the Time when ye ſpeak; <hi>Words ſpoken in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</hi> The Prophet notes it as a ſpecial part of Wiſdom in him that hath the Tongue of the Learned, to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon. Thus <hi>Abigail</hi> dealt with <hi>Nabal,</hi> ſhe would not tell him of his folly and danger in his Drunken Fit, but when the Wine was out of his Brain.</p>
               <p>Now for the better Learning of all this, I will recommend to you a few Rules of Direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be careful to keep a continual watch over your Tongues, and to take diligent heed to the words that paſs from you. <hi>I ſaid, I will take heed unto my ways,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.1.</note> ſaith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>that I offend not with my Tongue.</hi> It is with your Talking, as with your Walking: If ye do not take heed to your Feet when you Walk, you may happen to ſtumble. So if you do not take heed to your Tongues when you Talk, they may happen to run wild.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With Watchfulneſs joyn Prayer: Pray heartily and frequently unto God,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:174423:130"/>that he would reſtrain your Tongues from evil-ſpeaking, and open them in uttering the things that be good. Thus did <hi>Agur, Remove from me Vanity and Lyes,</hi> Prov. 30.8. Thus did <hi>David, Set a Watch, O Lord, before my Mouth, and keep the door of my Lips,</hi> &amp;c. As ye muſt beg Pardon of him, when ye have offended in the miſgoverning your Tongues, ſo for the guiding and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governing of them, ye muſt be Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners to Him: Only He that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to you, can teach you how to govern them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learn Humility in obſerving your ſelves, that will teach you Sobriety in ſpeaking of others: For whence is our Curioſity in obſerving, our Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in condemning others, but meerly from an opinionative Self-love, and a proud Conceit that Men have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tamdiu quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſua pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ignorat, quamdiu cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſè aliena conſiderat.</hi> Bernard.</note> So long a Man is ignorant in ſeeing his own Faults, as he is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to pry into other Mens. And to this purpoſe, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> gives good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>Enter into thine own Heart,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and let thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:174423:130"/>be thy Judg; bring thy ſelf to a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom. Homil. 43. in Math.</note> and ponder in thy ſelf the manifold Sins that thou knoweſt thy ſelf to have committed; think of the Puniſhments that are due unto thee for them, and ask thy ſelf the queſtion, How thou dareſt do this, or that? If thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then offer to flie back, and to baffle thee with other Mens faults,</hi> Dic ad ipſam, non ego Judex in alios: Anſwer her roundly; <hi>God hath not made thee a Judg of others, thou haſt enough of thine own to anſwer for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Learn ever to be more ready to Hear than to Speak. So <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, That he was careful to do. Thus he ſpeaks to <hi>Job</hi> and his three Friends, <hi>Behold, I waited for your Words; I gave ear to your Reaſons, whilſt you ſearched out what to ſay,</hi> &amp;c. Job 32.11. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is the way to get Wiſdom, to hear much, and ſpeak little. He that hears much, ſhall learn much; he that talks much ſhall learn little. If you deſire to ſpeak much, <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, you ſhould do it by a Soliloquy, <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum cum aliis loqui, plurimum vobiſcum:</hi> Speak little to others, moſt to your
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:174423:131"/>ſelves. It is the ſame the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>We ſhould be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> James 1.19. Yea, we ſhould be twice as ſwift to hear as to ſpeak; becauſe Nature hath given us but one Organ to ſpeak with, two to hear with.</p>

               <head>SECT. XXXV. <hi>A Meditation on the Miſeries of this Life.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is good for a Chriſtian every Day, to Meditate ſeriouſly on the Miſeries of this Life. And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider of the ſhortneſs of it. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Man's days are determined, the number of his Months are with God, and that he hath appointed his Bounds that he cannot paſs,</hi> Job 14.5. <hi>The days of our Years are threeſcore and ten: And if by reaſon of Strength they be fourſcore Years, yet is their ſtrength Labour and Sorrow, for it is ſoon cut off, and we flie away.</hi> And hereof you cannot well reckon the time of your Infancy for any part of your Life, for in that Age there is nothing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:174423:131"/>either learnt or done, that may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeem the Dignity of a Man.</p>
               <p>And as touching the time that is ſpent in Sleep, I ſee not how that can well be called the time of Life; ſeeing the principal part of our Life, is to have the uſe of our Senſes and Reaſon, which then are (as it were) ſuſpended in us, and dead. Therefore a Philoſopher ſaid, that in the half of Man's Life, there is no difference between the happy Man and unhappy, for as much as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Sleep, all Men are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, becauſe they then be as if they were dead.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe a certain Poet termeth Sleep the Couſin-germane of Death. And another called it the Brother of Death, yea, Death's Elder Brother: For there is a near reſemblance between the one and the other. Multitudes of People do ſleep the third part of the Day and Night, which is eight whole Hours (and ſome more) whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that a third part of our Lives is conſumed in ſleep, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that during that time we do not live.</p>
               <p>That Philoſopher had good reaſon to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:174423:132"/>do as he did, who being demanded what he thought of the Life of Man, turn'd himſelf about before them that made the Demand, and ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of their ſight; giving them thereby to underſtand, that our Life is very ſhort, and but as it were a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. And in a very ſhort time after a Man's Death, the very remembrance of him periſheth. Some of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents call Man's Life a Dream; yea, the dream of a Shadow.</p>
               <p>But compare this ſmall remnant of Life we live here, with the Life to come, and how little will it appear? What is this Momentany Life, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Life Everlaſting, but as it were a drop of Water compared with the whole Ocean? If a thouſand Years in the ſight of God, be no more but as it were Yeſterday, which is now paſt and gone, what ſhall the Life of ſeventy or eighty Years ſeem to be, but only a very nothing, compared to Eternity?</p>
               <p>Chriſtian Reader, Think then with thy ſelf every Day, what greater Folly and Madneſs can be imagined, than that Men and Women for the enjoying of this ſhort dream of ſuch vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:174423:132"/>and Pleaſures, ſhould plunge themſelves into everlaſting Torments? and what ſottiſhneſs hath poſſeſſed Men, that they ſhould take ſo much Labour and Pains to provide ſo many things for ſo ſhort a Life, and not to make any proviſion at all for their Souls, which ſhall live for ever?</p>
               <p n="2">II. Meditate alſo of the uncertainty of your Life. As our Life is very ſhort, ſo it is alſo uncertain. Eccleſ. 9.12. <hi>Man knoweth not his time: As the Fiſhes that are taken in an evil Net; and as the Birds that are caught in the Snare, ſo are the Sons of Men ſnared in an evil time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them.</hi> How often are Men ſurprized with ſudden Changes, as Birds in a Snare, and Fiſhes in a Net?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watch ye therefore, and be always in readineſs, becauſe ye know not the Hour when the Son of Man cometh;</hi> becauſe ye know not the Year, be therefore always in readineſs every Year: And becauſe ye know not the Month, watch every Month; and becauſe ye know not the Hour, watch every Hour. I will give you a Compariſon brought to my Hand by a Devout Man. Suppoſe there were
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:174423:133"/>ſet before thee upon a Table, thirty or 40 ſeveral Diſhes of Meat, and thou wert told by a ſpecial Friend, that there was Poyſon in one of them, thou wouldeſt ſcarce adventure to eat of any one of them, although thou wert much an hungred, for fear peradventure leſt thou ſhouldſt light upon the Diſh that was Poyſoned. Now perhaps thou mayſt think, that thou ſhalt live thirty or forty Years. Well then! If it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that in one of theſe Years thou ſhalt die, and thou knoweſt not in which of them, why art thou not then afraid in every one of them; and doſt not every Year, yea, every Day make preparation for Death?</p>
               <p>Why do Souldiers keep a continual Watch in the Caſtle that ſtandeth in the Frontiers, upon an Enemies Country? Is it for any other cauſe, but only for that they know not when the Enemies will come to Aſſault it? Surely for none other. Oh then, ſeeing you know not at what hour Death will aſſault you, you had always need to be Watchful; thy Soul is of greater value than all the Caſtles and Kingdoms of the World, and thou haſt greater Enemies that do
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:174423:133"/>endeavour Day and Night continually to aſſault it, and thou art altogether ignorant of the Day and Hour of thine Aſſault, and the whole matter of the Salvation or Damnation of thy Soul, conſiſteth in this Point, whether thou be taken provided or unprovided in that dreadful Hour.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Conſider the frailty and brittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Man's Life, no Glaſs is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to knocks and breaking as the Life of Man. Some loſe their Life by the vehement heat of the Sun; the Eyes of ſome are able to bereave others of their Life. Some die by drinking a draught of cold Drink in a Sweat, or by Surfeiting at a Supper. Some die of exceſſive Pleaſure or Grief. Some ſeem to go well to Bed, and there are found dead in the Morning. We may not wonder how ſoon Men end their Lives, as how they endure ſo long, the Workmanſhip of their Bodies being ſo tender, and the Matter and Stuff where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they be compounded, ſo frail and weak. God bids the Prophet cry, <hi>All fleſh is Graſs, and all the glory thereof like the Flower of the Field: The Graſs wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, the Flower fadeth,</hi> &amp;c. What
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:174423:134"/>is the Graſs, but the Earth's Summer Garment, which is put off before Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cometh?</p>
               <p>To Day thou mayſt ſee a young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in the flower of his Age, ſtrong and lively, jetting up and down in rich Attire, and with a lofty Countenance; and to Morrow a violent Diſeaſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, may ſtrangely disfigure and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Some are ſore broken with Adverſities, others are pinched with Penury and Poverty. Some are diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with delicate Meats, and ſweet Wines; others are debilitated with Age. Some mar their Complexions with Artificial Paintings, and Riotous Behaviour, ſo that their Fleſh withereth like Graſs, and the Flower thereof fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth away.</p>
               <p>May ye not to Day ſee ſome deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Noble Parentage, of a very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Houſe and Family, well Friended, and keeping a great Houſe, attended with a great Train of Tenants and Servants, and Commanding the whole Country where they live; and within a few Days after ye may ſee the ſame Men forſaken of all their Friends, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by their Equals, and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:174423:134"/>of all the World; utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, and thruſt into that Priſon, where perhaps they not long before had Impriſoned others, and there to end their wretched and miſerable Life? O ſinful Man, thou that drinkeſt down Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity like Water, that walloweſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſinful Delights and Pleaſures, doſt thou not plainly ſee, that whenſoever the Thred of this frail and ſhort Life of thine breaketh in ſunder, that if thou continueſt ſtill in this thy wicked Courſe, thou ſhalt fall into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit of Deſtruction? How then canſt thou Sing, Laugh, Play, or Sleep, and take any Reſt? How is it that thou art ſo ſenſeleſs of thy Peril and Danger, who art ready every moment to drop into the Pit of Hell?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Meditate on the variableneſs of this Life. The <hi>Camelion</hi> changeth himſelf often into divers colours, and the Moon into divers ſhapes: But who is able to reckon up the alterations that are in Man? Now he ſmiles, anon he frowns; now he is pleaſed, but by and by diſpleaſed; now he is merry, anon he is ſad and penſive; now he is well, by and by he is ſick: ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:174423:135"/>ſometimes diſcontented; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times full of Hope, ſometimes in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; ſometimes pleaſed, ſometimes angry. That which is paſt is irkſome to him; that which is preſent is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; and that which is to come diſquiets him. He is careful in getting Goods, fearful of loſing, and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in parting with them. And how doth Man's Life continually move and waſte away; for every minute he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtep further towards his Death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that his Days were ſwifter than a Poſt.
<note place="margin">Job 9.25.</note> He that rides Poſt, though his Meſſage require never ſo much haſte, yet ſometimes neceſſity cauſeth him to ſtay; but our Life never ſtayeth one moment. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I take in Hand, whatſoever I write, whatſoever I reade over again, and correct, each thing takes from me ſome part of my Life. And look how many points and minims the Notary writeth, ſo many are the loſſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſings of my Life: Inſomuch, that like as they that ſail in a Ship, whether they ſtand or ſit, are always going and ſailing, and do ever approach nearer to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:174423:135"/>the end of their Navigation: Even ſo all the time that we live here, we walk and paſs on forward ſtill, approaching nearer and nearer to Death, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Haven at which we muſt all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Meditate on the Treacherouſneſs of this Life; it is full of Deceit and Guile. O Man, doſt thou perceive (ſaith the forementioned Father) when thou waſt made an Infant? Canſt thou tell when thou waſt made a Stripling? Or when thou cameſt to Man's Eſtate? Or when thou didſt begin to be Old? We Die every day, we are in Deaths often, and yet vain Man would perſwade himſelf he ſhall Live for ever.</p>
               <p>This made the <hi>Megarenſes</hi> raiſe ſuch ſtately and ſumptuous Buildings, of whom a certain Philoſopher ſaith, That they builded as though they ſhould live for ever, and they lived as though they ſhould die the next day. Wherefore do Men labour ſo much in gathering Riches, and in purchaſing of Lands, and make ſo little preparation for Death, is it not becauſe that they do perſwade themſelves, that their Life ſhall long endure? This falſe Conceit
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:174423:136"/>makes them believe, that they ſhall have time enough for all things: That they ſhall have time for their Pleaſures, Luſts, Vanities, and Worldly Buſineſſes; and that after all this, they ſhall have time enough alſo before they Die, to make their Account ready, and to make their Atonement with God.</p>
               <p>This vain perſwaſion is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any Reaſon, or true Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only upon Self-love, which as it naturally hateth the thoughts of Death, ſo will it not believe, that it will come ſoon to his Houſe as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's; moſt Men are loth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing, that may be an occaſion of ſo great Pain and Grief unto them as the ſame would be.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Meditate on the manifold Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this Life: So many are the Calamities and Miſeries of Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, as that it deſerves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name of Death than Life. Were your Eyes opened to ſee your own caſe, you would always lament and bewail your Eſtate, as Men condemned by God Almighty, to endure ſuch Miſeries. Conſider firſt the External Miſeries of the Body; Who is able to count them?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:174423:136"/>What pains and toil do Men take to get Food, whereby to ſuſtain their Lives, either by the ſweat of their Brows, or the ſweat of their Brains? The Beaſts of the Earth, and Birds of the Air, are fed without any Labour or Pain: But Man is conſtrained to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Day and Night, and to turmoil by Sea and Land, to get his Living. And as the Spider laboureth Day and Night in ſpinning her Web, waſting even her own Bowels, and conſuming her ſelf to bring it to an end, which ſerves only for a Net to catch Flies in; even ſo all Man's Travel ſerves to no other end, but only to catch Flies, to procure Trifles, and things of little Value.</p>
               <p>Who is able to reckon up the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diverſities of Diſeaſes, to which the Body of Man is ſubject? Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their Books write of abundance of Diſeaſes, and Remedies for the ſame; and yet their Science is enlarged every Day by the eruption of new and ſtrange Diſeaſes, which the Phyſicians of old were altogether ignorant of.</p>
               <p>And even thoſe Complexions that have been free from theſe Miſeries, yet
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:174423:137"/>are they not exempt from other Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and Miſchances. How many thouſand Men hath the Sea ſwallowed up? How many hath the Sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured? How many hath the Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed? How many have been killed by the falling down of Houſes, Walls, Towers? How many with the ſtrokes and ſtings of Venemous Beaſts? How many Women die in Travel of their Children, and dearly purchaſe their Childrens Lives with their own painful Deaths? The very brute Beaſts that were made to ſerve us, do rebel againſt us: And among all other Creatures, Man is moſt cruelly bent againſt Man.</p>
               <p>What abundance of Engines, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, Weapons, and Munition have Men deviſed for their own defence, and to offend others? In ſo much as when we are not moleſted with the Air, nor the Elements, Men become Wolves and Devils to one another. <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks of a notable Philoſopher, who wrote a Book concerning the Deaths of Men, wherein he reciteth the occaſions of Mens Deaths that have hapned in the World, as by Inundations, Sword, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Peſtilence, diverſities of Diſeaſes,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:174423:137"/>deſtructions of Cities, concourſe of Wild-Beaſts, which ruſhing in ſuddenly upon ſome Nations, have utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them: And yet in the cloſe of all, he concludeth, That a far greater number of Men have been deſtroyed by Men, than by all the other kind of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, though they were all joyned together. But if in this Diſcourſe I ſhould run through all the Miſeries and Calamities that are incident to all the Ages and Conditions of this Life, Men might yet find themſelves in a far worſe caſe: And here we ſhould never make an end, if we ſhould ſet forth the little ſatisfaction that is to be found in each of theſe, and that eager deſire that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath to change his Condition with the State of others. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof made St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay, That he thought this Life little better than the life of Hell it ſelf; were it not for the hope that here we may have to attain to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, Meditate on Death it ſelf, which ſucceedeth after other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Who is able to declare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Miſeries that are included in this Miſery alone? At preſent conſider what
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:174423:138"/>an holy Father ſaith, by way of Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt Death; O Death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee? How ſuddenly doſt thou ſteal upon us? How ſecret are thy Paths and Ways? How doubtful is thy Hour? How uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal is thy Dominion? The Mighty cannot eſcape thy Hands; the Wiſe cannot hide themſelves from thee, and in thy preſence the Strong loſe their ſtrength. Thou accounteſt no Man Rich, for no Man can ranſome his Life of thee for Money; Thou goeſt every where, Thou ſearcheſt every where, there is no place where thou art not. Thou withereſt the Herbs, thou drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt up the Winds, thou corrupteſt the Air, thou changeſt the Ages, thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt the World, thou ſtickeſt not to ſup up the Sea. All things do increaſe and diminiſh, but thou continueſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at one ſtay. Thou art the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that always ſtrikeſt; thou art the Sword that never blunteth; thou art the Snare whereinto every one falleth; thou art the Priſon whereinto every one entreth; thou art the Sea wherein all do periſh. Thou art the Pain that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:174423:138"/>one ſuffereth, and the Tribute that every one payeth.</p>
               <p>O cruel Death, why haſt thou no pity of us, but ſtealeſt ſuddenly upon us, to ſnatch us away in our beſt Times, and interrupt us in our beſt Affairs? Thou robbeſt as much from us in one Hour, as we have gained in many Years. Thou cutteſt off the ſucceſſion of Kindreds and Families; thou leaveſt Princes and Kingdoms without any Heirs; thou filleſt the World with Widows and Orphans; thou breakeſt off the ſtudies of great Clerks; thou overthroweſt good Wits in their ripeſt Age; thou joyneſt the End with the Beginning, without giving place to the Middle. Thus He. How ſhould the conſideration of theſe things make us willing to part hence, when Death ſhall ſound the Retreat? <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith elegantly,

Of this the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors ſay, The continual Sacrifice of the Morning, made Atonement for the Iniquities that were done in the Night: And the Evening-ſacrifice made Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Iniquities that were by Day.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:174423:139"/>
               <p>This ſhould teach us daily to renew the application of the Sacrifice of Chriſt (typified by the Lamb) once offered to the Father for us. Receive him, feed upon him, and make daily Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of him, even Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make an humble confeſſion of your Sins, with much holy Contrition and godly Sorrow, and then preſent Chriſt and all his Merits unto God, and ſprinkle thy Conſcience afreſh with his Blood. Renew thy hold of him, and embrace him more ſtrongly; let your Faith be daily exerciſed upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Lord did meet with the People, and ſpeak with them in the place where the Lamb was offered continually, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.42. So, if we daily, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, by a true and lively Faith, do renew the Application of Chriſt's Sacrifice to our Souls, we may be ſure that Chriſt will meet with us there, and ſpeak with us there. Oh how do we wrong our ſelves when we with-draw, and do not give Chriſt a meeting, when we abſent our ſelves Morning or Evening, and neglect thoſe holy Duties wherein we ſhould meet Jeſus Chriſt, and hear him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:174423:140"/>to us Peace and Pardon, Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Salvation? What ſweet comfort is to be found in all Eſtates, when thus we ſhall draw near to the Lord in theſe holy Duties? When we ſhall meet him, and hear his ſweet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Love by his Spirit to our Souls, it ſhould make us loth to depart, even hard to be pulled away from the Door of the Tabernacle, unwilling to end theſe exerciſes, or turn our thoughts another way, were it not that other things muſt be done. Therefore ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie your ſelves every one, and come to this daily Burnt-offering, Morning and Evening continually, that ye may meet the Lord, and hear him talk with you words of Peace and Love. Many complain that Chriſt is ſtrange unto them, they cannot ſee him, nor hear any word of Comfort from him; but the fault is in themſelves, they fail to give him a meeting, or to come in that holy manner as they ought.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 43. That hereupon <hi>the Tabernacle ſhould be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Glory of the Lord,</hi> when they ſhould come before him daily with this continual Burnt-offering, and he ſhould
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:174423:140"/>meet them, and ſpeak with them. In like manner, a Family, a Chriſtian is ſanctified by the Glory of the Lord through this daily Intercourſe with him. If ye daily meet the Lord in Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in renewing the Application of Chriſt to your Souls, in calling upon him for the accompliſhment of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and he on the other ſide meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with you, and ſpeaketh to you, then ſhall ye be ſanctified by the Glory of the Lord, ye ſhall ſee the light of his loving Countenance graciouſly and gloriouſly ſhining upon your Souls. This hath a Sanctifying Virtue and Power in it. As the Sun ſhining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gloriouſly from time to time on Trees and Fruits, doth give growing ſweetneſs and ripeneſs to theſe Fruits: So Chriſt by meeting us, and ſhining on our Souls with the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when we preſent our ſelves before him aright in the due and daily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Service, and offering of this Sacrifice, he doth ſanctifie us by his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he doth alter the temper of our Souls, he doth change and faſhion us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his likeneſs, in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, from Glory to Glory by his Spirit.</p>

               <p>IT is good before you lie down to Sleep, to take a review of all the Actions and Mercies of the paſt Day.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt know the Sins thou haſt committed the Day paſt, or the Week paſt, or thy whole Life paſt, thou mayſt briefly run over all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and thou mayſt eaſily ſee what Commandments thou haſt Tranſgreſſed, and ſo mayſt be humbled for thy Sins, and mayſt renew thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and reſolutions for better Obedience. Look diligently into the whole ſtate of thy Life, conſider what progreſs thou haſt made in Godlineſs, or how thou haſt declined: What Words thou haſt ſpoken, what Works thou haſt done, and to what end, and in what manner they were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:174423:141"/>
               <p>Conſider thine Apparel, thy Service, thine Attendance, thy Table, thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, thy Entertainment, and all thy Dealings and Demeanour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have not ſavoured of Pride and Vanity; and let this be matter of Humiliation to thee.</p>
               <p>Take a ſtrict examen of thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence every Evening: For if Conſcience condemn, God doth much more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: And if Conſcience acquit and juſtifie, by the evidence of the Word and Spirit, God doth Acquit and Juſtifie, and we ſhall have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward God. What can more nearly concern us, than daily to make a thorow and careful ſearch of our own Conſciences? Shall Men be ſo careful to examine their Evidences, by which they hold Lands and Annuities, their Leaſes whereby they hold Farms; and ſhall we be ſo careleſs as to let our Hearts and Conſcienccs lie unexamined and unſearched?</p>
               <p>I have read a Story of a certain King, who after a long time of Bloody Wars, which cauſed a great confuſion in Men's outward Eſtates, in a publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, called upon his Subjects to ſhew
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:174423:142"/>their Evidences, by which they held their Lands; whereupon the Nobles being loth to have their Writings exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, drew their Swords, and ſaid, By theſe they held their Lands. So there are many that cannot endure to ſearch their Hearts and Conſciences, becauſe they have no ſound hope to find their Evidence good and clear to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Unleſs ye be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, your Conſciences when they be indeed awakened and enlightned, will condemn you Guilty in the ſight of God, and will condemn the beſt of your Actions as not wrought in God, nor done in the Name of Chriſt, not proceeding from the Love of God, nor intended for his Glory. Now ere ye can find your ſelves juſtified by Faith in Chriſt through the Goſpel, ye muſt find your Conſciences condemning you for Sin, and therefore daily yield them to be ſearched and convinced by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Take a review every Evening like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of all the Gifts, Graces, Bleſſings, Benefits, God hath beſtowed upon thee, and conſider after what ſort thou
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:174423:142"/>haſt employed them the Day paſt; and examine whether all theſe things, wherewith thou ſhouldſt have done the more Service unto him who gave them, thou haſt not made Weapons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, wherewith to offend him the more. Examine how thou haſt uſed thy Strength, thy Health, thy Riches, thy Subſtance, thy Life, thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, thy Memory, thy Will, thy Affections, thy Sight, thy Tongue, thine Ears, thy Hands, and all the reſt of thy Members and Faculties: And then let the conſideration of God's Benefits make thee to acknowledg him, and his Goodneſs to love him: As we are not to ſlight common Mercies, yet extraordinary Mercies muſt be more ſpecially and particularly obſerved by us.</p>

               <p>IT is good Advice that one giveth, that a Chriſtian ſhould begin from the Evening, the purpoſe of good Works which he is to perform the next Day; what points he ought to meditate upon; what Vice he ſhould reſiſt; what Vertue he ſhould exerciſe; what Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs he is to take in hand, to make all appear in its proper time, with a well matured Providence. It is the Thred of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> which guideth our Actions in the great labyrinth of Time, otherwiſe all runneth to Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Some commend the Evening as a fit time for Meditation, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Sun-ſetting to the Twi-light. It is ſaid of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that he went forth into the Field in the Evening, to meditate and to pray. The Original Word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies both Duties. It is conceived by ſome Interpreters, that <hi>David</hi> penned the eighth Pſalm in the Night, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:174423:143"/>by his meditation on the Works of God.</p>
               <p>In the Evening, conſider that every Morning hath its Evening, and the longeſt Day hath its Night. So every Man's day of Life, will have its night of Death. The longeſt day of Life, will have its night of Death. Think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſpeech of our Saviour,
<note place="margin">John 9.4.</note> 
                  <hi>I muſt Work while it is Day, for the Night cometh wherein no Man can Work.</hi> There is no work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out your Salvation, when the night of Death is come.</p>
               <p>If thou, O Man, haſt ſpent the Day in vain delights and pleaſures, ask thy ſelf in the Evening, what ſatisfaction thou haſt found in thoſe Vanities which thou haſt ſo eagerly purſued all the Day before; and what comfort they now afford unto thee? Ah! they are now gone and paſſed, and they have left but a ſad reliſh behind. But if yet thou reſolveſt to tread the ſame paths of Sin and Deſtruction again, be thou well aſſured, that a Night will come which ſhall never have Morning. When be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered with the ſhadow of Death, thou ſhalt lie down in everlaſting Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:174423:144"/>Then wilt thou cry out in the anguiſh of thy Soul, O what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Wretch am I, that had time and opportunity to gain that bleſſed State which Angels and Saints do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in the Kingdom of Heaven, and would not uſe the benefit thereof! O how idly and wickedly hath the time of my Life paſſed away, which ſhall never return again! And now for a few momentany Pleaſures on Earth, I muſt ſuffer intollerable and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Torments in Hell. O unhappy Pleaſures! O curſed Change! O unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Hour and Moment, wherein I thus blinded my ſelf! What a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretch am I! A thouſand, yea, ten thouſand times unhappy, that have ſo fondly deceived my ſelf! Oh, it had been well if I had never been Born.</p>

               <head>SECT. XXXIX. <hi>A Meditation in putting off our Clothes to go to Bed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. HEre conſider, that Clothes do not make nor mar a Man: The Body ceaſeth not to be a Body when the Clothes are put off, that the Body may take its reſt in a warm Bed. So it is not the Body that makes a Man, <hi>Animus cujuſque quiſque,</hi> it is the Mind, or Soul of Man that is the Man. When the Body is laid aſide in the Grave, a Man doth not then ceaſe to be; but his Soul is then taking its reſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or tormented in Hell. Death is not an Annihilation of a Man, but only a Diſſolution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, That as a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes himſelf before he goes to take his reſt in his Bed; ſo Death to a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, is but an unclothing of him for Sleep and Reſt: And here meditate on the reſemblances between Death and the unclothing of our ſelves for Sleep and Reſt.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:174423:145"/>
               <p n="1">1. Before a Man lays off his Clothes, he doth ungirt himſelf, he unbuttons and untieth his Garments, that he may put them off. Thus ordinarily before the Soul is unclothed of the Body, God ſendeth Sickneſs, one Diſeaſe or other to ungirt and let looſe the Body, ſo nearly united to the Soul of Man. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I deſire (ſaith he) to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>Niſi ſe vinctum putaverat, non op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taverat diſſolvi.</hi> If he had not thought his Soul bound and girt to his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he would not have deſired to been diſſolved. Every Ach, Pain, and Sickneſs that God lays upon the Body, is, and ought to be a forewarning to thee, that it is almoſt Bed-time: It is death's Harbinger, and God's Servant, ſent it may be to fetch and carry thee to thy Bed, to thy place of Reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Man cannot take ſuch ſweet refreſhment in his Clothes, as when he is Unclothed. So a Godly Man can never reſt from his Labours whilſt he is in the Body; but he will be always burdened, wearied, and groaning in this Earthly Tabernacle; he is born to Labour, as the Sparks flie upward:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:174423:145"/>There is no hope of reſting from Sin, from Temptation, from Trouble, from Labours without, and from Fears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, till a Chriſtian lays aſide his Body, the Garment of the Soul; Death makes him to reſt from all his Labours. While the Soul is in the Body, it is abſent from the Lord, the proper Reſt of the Soul, the Saints everlaſting Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But Death carries <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a Man puts off all his Clothes to go to his Bed, he lies not down naked and uncovered, but takes a Covering upon him. Thus when the Soul leaves the Body, it lays aſide his Clothes, yet lies not he without a Covering: Man's Bed is his Grave, and the Earth is his Covering. A Pious Man may think upon his Burial in a Grave, as a Cheſt or Coffer, wherein his Body (the Apparel of his Soul) is laid up till the Morning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: But a Wicked Man may think on it as a dark Priſon, reſerving his Body (as his Soul is reſerved in Hell in chains of darkneſs) until the Judgment of the great Day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When a Man puts off his Clothes,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:174423:146"/>he lays aſide all his rich Ornaments with them. Thus when the Soul lays aſide the Body, it lays aſide alſo all a Man's Honours, Preferments, Riches, Pleaſures, and whatſoever the vain Heart of Man prides himſelf in. We came forth naked into the World, and naked we ſhall return out of the World. We came forth Naked, which ſheweth Men were not born to great Matters; and Naked we ſhall return, to ſhew the vanity of Men in looking after great Matters; for when the Rich and the Honourable Man die, <hi>they ſhall carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing away with them, and their Glory ſhall not deſcend after them,</hi> Pſal. 49.17. Oh conſider, what a lamentable thing it is for Men to lay aſide theſe things at Death, and to have no Ornament but the uglineſs of Sin to appear before God in!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Men put off their Clothes in hope after they have refreſhed themſelves with Sleep, to put them on again. So when the Soul lays aſide her Body, it is in hope of riſing again, of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of the Soul with the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which a Man did lay aſide; ſo to put off the Body, as one that ſhall put
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:174423:146"/>it on again in a more glorious manner, and never lay it aſide more.</p>

               <p>HAving recounted the Mercies of the Day, think on the dangers of the Night. It is ſaid of Thieves and Robbers, that in the dark they dig through Houſes, which they have mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for themſelves in the Day-time, <hi>Job</hi> 24.16. The Word in the Original, ſignifies to mark with a Seal, as if they did put their Seal upon other Mens Houſes for their own uſe. Thieves ſet their Mark upon ſuch Houſes in the Day-time, which they intend to Rob at Night. Or (as ſome expound it) they obſerve the ſtrength of the Houſe, the ways to it, what Company is in the Houſe, and where they may with moſt facility and advantage break into it. Houſes are marked out in the Day, and broken open in the Night; many Houſes alſo are fired in the Night, and how

                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:174423:148"/>helpleſs is Man amidſt theſe Caſualties and Dangers? If he be aſleep, the Thief finds him bound to his hand; and if Fire take his Chamber, how ready is the Fire to conſume him in his Bed? At midnight the Lord ſmote all the Firſt-born in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from the Firſt-born of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c. unto the Firſt-born of the Captive that was in the Dungeon, and all the Firſt-born of Cattel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29. It was in the Night that the Angel of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was ſlain at Noon upon his Bed: but the Night hath been fatal unto many.</p>
               <p>Acknowledg it a mercy, that God affordeth you reſt after Labour. <hi>Man goeth forth unto his Work, and to his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour until the Evening,</hi> Pſal. 104.23. <hi>for ſo</hi> (or rightly) <hi>he giveth his Beloved ſleep.</hi> Life and Strength would fail for want of Reſt, as for want of Food. A good Chriſtian may go to Bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear. You ſhall find many Promiſes in Scripture, about this Bleſſing. Prov. 3.24. <hi>When thou lieſt down thou ſhalt not be afraid, yea, thou ſhalt lie down,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:174423:148"/>and thy ſleep ſhall be ſweet,</hi> Job. 11.18. Thou ſhalt take thy reſt in ſafety, thou ſhalt lie down, and none ſhall make thee afraid. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I laid me down, and ſlept, I awaked, for the Lord ſuſtained me.</hi> Pſal. 4.8. <hi>I will both lay me down in peace, and ſleep, for thou, Lord, makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi> Every Member of Jeſus Chriſt is ſecure through Faith in him. The Shepherd wakes when others are aſleep, to keep his Sheep from the Wolf. God is the Keeper of his Flock, he is always vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to defend them. <hi>Behold, He that is the Keeper of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſhall never ſlumber nor ſleep: the Lord is thy Keeper,</hi> Pſal. 121.4, 5. St. <hi>Peter</hi> feared not to ſleep in Priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6. Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> our Proto-Martyr in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, could ſcarce be waked, when the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came to warn him to prepare for the Fire, having been condemned to be Burnt alive. When the Lord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes our Protection, we may ſleep as our Saviour did, in the midſt of a Storm and Tempeſt. As a good Nights reſt is the Gift of God, ſo it deſerves daily acknowledgments by us.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving Prayed immediately before you go to Reſt, offer your Reſt it ſelf to God, in this or the like manner: My God! I deſire as often as I ſhall draw breath this Night, ſo often all my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations may praiſe thee.
<note place="margin">Drexel. <hi>de rect. intent. lib.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Drexelius</hi> adviſeth a Chriſtian to ſuppoſe that he heareth Chriſt ſpeaking to him in theſe words: When any one will repoſe himſelf to Sleep, let him meditate ſomewhat of Me, or confer with Me: For ſo, although he ſleep in Body, yet he ſhall watch in Mind unto Me: Yea, let every one which is ready to cloſe his Eyes, deſire that I would receive every breath which he ſhall fetch that Night, as it were to my exceeding Praiſe; and I who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting to the holy Wiſhes of a pious and loving Soul, will fulfil his deſires in Truth. It is of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:174423:149"/>to a Chriſtian, to reduce all things in this manner to the Honour of God; and there is no moment of time, but we might be on the getting hand.</p>
               <p>It is good to empty your ſelves, before you ſleep of all that troubles you. It was <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his rule to his Scholar, <hi>Non te prius ſomno tradideris quam diurna opera ter mente revolveris:</hi> Betake not thy ſelf to ſleep, till thou haſt in thy Mind gone thrice over the works of the Day.</p>
               <p>The ſleep of a Godly Man is ſweet; but the ſleep of many wicked Men is very troubleſome. <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, King of <hi>England;</hi> after the murder of his two Nephews, had fearful Dreams, and would leap off of his Bed, and take his Sword in his hand, as if he had been ſeeking an Enemy. And <hi>Charles</hi> IX, King of <hi>France,</hi> after the French Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, was laid to ſleep every Night, and wakened by Muſicians.</p>
               <p>But good Men ſometimes through Grief and Pain, may find little eaſe, or refreſhing from their Beds. Thus <hi>Job</hi> amplifies his Sorrows, inſtancing in thoſe ordinary Ways, which give ſick and diſtempered Bodies ſome abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:174423:150"/>or intermiſſion of their Pain, lying down upon their Bed, or Couch. <hi>When I ſay, my Bed ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 7.13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>my Couch ſhall eaſe my complaint, then thou ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt me with Dreams, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieſt me with Viſions.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Whilſt I was all Day conflicting with my Sorrows, I yet had ſome hope to find comfort at Night, that I ſhould find reſt on my Bed: Or whilſt in the Day my Spirit is overwhelmed within me, I think ſometimes to deceive my Pains a little, by taking a Nap on my Couch.</p>
               <p>Conſider here, That the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper Means, are unable of themſelves to miniſter any Eaſe or Comfort to us. A Man may go to his Bed, and lie down upon his Couch in vain: unleſs God command a Bed to comfort us, it ſhall yield us no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and unleſs he ſay to a Couch, Eaſe ſuch a Man's Complaint, it ſhall not do it. But if God will ſay to an hard Stone, give ſuch a Man reſt, he ſhall reſt and ſleep ſweetly upon it; as <hi>Jacob</hi> did when he journeyed from <hi>Beer-ſheba</hi> towards <hi>Haran,</hi> making Stones
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:174423:150"/>his Pillows in the place where he lay down to ſleep,

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.11, 12, 13, 14.</note> there dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Ladder ſet upon the Earth, the top whereof reached to Heaven, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending on it, and the Lord ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above it, promiſing to give the Land whereon he lay, to him and his Seed, and to multiply his Seed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and that in his Seed all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>How often doth God ſcare ſome Men with Dreams, and terrifie them with Viſions? as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks concerning himſelf. Sometimes Satan cauſeth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and filthy Dreams,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.</note> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> bewails in the tenth Book of his Confeſſions: Sometimes treacherous and deluding Dreams. Some conceive, that the Dream of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.19. was from the Devil, becauſe Satan would thereby have hindred the work of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. She comes to <hi>Pilat,</hi> and deſires him to have nothing to do with
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:174423:151"/>that Juſt Man, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>I have ſuffered many things this Night in a Dream becauſe of him.</hi> As our waking times are in God's Hand, ſo our ſleeping times. Sometimes God makes ſleep an Affliction to us. <hi>Job</hi>'s Dreams were Terrifying and Scaring to him. Some Dreams are for Warning and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>The Lord warned</hi> Joſeph <hi>in a Dream;</hi> the Angel of the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in a Dream whilſt he thought on thoſe things, and gave him Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel what to do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. Holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations even upon our Beds, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times meet with the Lord's Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The Angels are at God's Service to aſſiſt his Saints, as here of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> he helps him out of his perplexed Thoughts. He was contriving how to pleaſe God in that Buſineſs of ſo great Importance, and God ſends an Angel to aſſiſt him. No time is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable for God to help his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: No time but he watcheth over them: When they are ſleeping, when they think neither harm nor good, then doth the Lord watch over them for good. God can give us better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:174423:151"/>ſleeping, than we can find out waking. Many a one hath taſted more of Heaven in a Night-dream, than in many Days attendance on holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Yet this is no Pillow for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs: If we do our beſt while we are waking, God will relieve us ſleeping. Let us go to God, and not diſtract our ſelves, nor be careleſs. <hi>Joſeph</hi> thought what to do, yet his thoughts were not ſo diſtracting as to break his ſleep: God helps him ſleeping. God will have us be doing, and yet it may be, he will do his own Work without us.</p>
               <p>Let every Chriſtian labour to be well employed in the Day-time, for (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks) it is poſſible, that our Fancy in the Night may hold ſome conformity with the Days employment: F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
